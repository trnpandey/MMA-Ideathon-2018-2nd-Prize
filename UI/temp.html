  "It is our continued effort to innovate and create products that consumers love.  Kwality Walls launches a new irresistible flavor ‘Cornetto Oreo.’ This new flavour is a combination of creamy and crunchy textures, alleviated with the presence of Oreo and a chocolate disc. The richness of Oreo biscuit pieces combined with swirls of vanilla and a crunchy wafer cone is the perfect match to delight taste buds.  On the launch of the Cornetto Oreo, brand ambassador, Alia Bhatt said, “I’m extremely excited to launch this epic new flavor that celebrates the coming together of two of the yummiest and loved brands. To me, ‘Cornetto Oreo’ is the perfect match that combines the best of both worlds, crunch and cream in one cone. It’s absolutely irresistible!”  About Cornetto: Launched in 1960 in Italy, Cornetto has always been a brand of the youth, encouraging them to enjoy special moments to the fullest. Cornetto is one the world’s leading ice- cream brands and is synonymous with an Ice-Cream Cone, owned by Kwality Wall’s. ","It is understood that Unilever is briefing agencies on its digital roster this week.  Cornetto unveiled a YouTube video in July about a love story involving two teenagers that enabled the audience to switch between two views. It was created by Mofilm and RSA Films.  In 2013, the brand launched a series of short films about love as part of a rebrand. The cupidity campaign on YouTube was also created by Mofilm and RSA Films. It won a silver Lion in Branded Content & Entertainment at Cannes in 2014. ","There will be smaller drops in the size of other ice-cream treats with a Magnum Almond, the most calorific of the brand’s choc-ices on sticks, dropping from 110ml to 100ml, a Magnum Classic will drop from 120ml to 110ml and just 2ml will be sliced off a Feast Chocolate, taking it down to 90ml.   Too wet for water biscuits as Carr's pauses production  Read more Unilever said some of its ice-cream products – worth £5.4m annually in UK retail sales – will be dropped altogether, including Magnum Infinity Chocolate & Caramel, which has 274 calories, Magnum Infinity Chocolate, and Cornetto Choc ’N’ Ball.  The food group said it had spent 18 months with a signifiant amount invested in research to achieve its aims of bringing all its “single-serving” ice-creams below 250 calories.  Noel Clarke, executive director of brand building for Unilever UK & Ireland said: “We have introduced this 250 calorie cap to help make it easier for our consumers to make informed and healthier choices when enjoying their favourite ice-creams as part of a balanced lifestyle.  Advertisement  “It was important there be no compromise to taste or quality and that’s exactly what we’ve delivered.”  However, the company is likely to be criticised for increasing the price per gramme of products under the veil of a healthy eating drive. Clarke admitted to the Grocer that there was a risk of a customer backlash but said he was confident shoppers would “appreciate what we are trying to do ... and buy more”.  The move comes after Unilever cut calories in children’s ice-creams, such as Funny Feet, Twister and Calippo, to 110 calories by 2012. Several confectionary companies have also cut the size of their snacks in response to the government’s anti-obesity drive.  Cadbury pledged 18 months ago to stop making and selling chocolate bars in the UK that contain more than 250 calories. It cut the weight of a Dairy Milk bar from 49g to 45g by making the corners more curvy.  And in 2012, Mars said it would cut the calorie content of its bars to a maximum of 250 by the end of 2013, in line with the public health responsibility deal promoted by Andrew Lansley, the former health secretary. That led to a Twix shrinking from 58g to 50g, a 14% reduction, and Snickers bars being cut down by 17% from 58g to 48g.  But the food companies have been criticised for shrinking the size of popular products as a way to make more money without making the changes clear to their customers. Just over a year ago, a survey found that Christmas treats, such as Cadbury’s Roses, Nestle’s Quality Street and Terry’s Chocolate Orange Segsations .  Mumsnet’s chief executive, Justine Roberts, said: “Issuing single-serving packs that come in at under 250 calories seems sensible enough – although of course we can’t necessarily promise that we won’t eat two, and lots of Mumsnet users are increasingly more concerned about sugar than they are about simple calories.  “Most consumers would probably hope the price would fall to reflect the size reduction but the truth is we’ll probably carry on buying the product anyway – albeit with a fair bit of grumbling.” ","From the moment Cornetto ice cream was launched during 1964, people have loved the delicious contrast of smooth ice cream topped with nuts and the chocolate pieces. Today, Cornetto is still the UK’s No 1 . Cornetto Ice Cream  Cornetto is the branded frozen ice cream cone, manufactured by the Unilever and marketed throughout the world by the various different company names. It is most familiar to British consumers as Walls' Cornetto.  The idea of selling frozen ice cream cones had been long a dream of ice cream makers, but it wasn't until 1959 that Spica, an Italian ice cream manufacturer based in Naples conquered the problem of the ice cream making the cone go soggy. Spica invented a process, whereby the inside of the waffle cone was also insulated from the ice cream by a layer of oil, sugar and chocolate. Spica registered the name of Cornetto in 1960. Initial sales were poor, but in 1976 Unilever bought out of Spica and began a mass-marketing campaign through Europe. It is now one of the most popular ice-creams in the world.  Passionate Ice Cream For those who are really passionate about any ice cream, Cornetto Passion is perfect for you - another delicious crisp is Cornetto ice cream in cone, filled with chocolate mousse, topped with delicate pannacotta ice cream swirled with a caramel sauce and the fudge chunks.  History Production of Cornetto began in 1959 by Spica; it was an Italian ice cream company. They made a big impression on the Unilever employees when they visited Spica in 1962. The company was actually acquired by Unilever soon afterwards.  Cornetto made a number of appearances in all over UK in the 1960s and 1970s but it was during a heat wave in during summer of 1976 that it really took off. Of course, certain advertising campaign the featuring a gondolier singing the famous theme tune 'Just one Cornetto’ also helped.  In 2004 the Cornetto team presented the Cornetto Love Potions, a limited edition range of six exotic cones in very exciting flavors combinations such as tiramisu & cinnamon, cappuccino & Irish Cream and also choc chip & hazelnut.  Did you know?Cornetto Ice Cream It was launched in 1976;Cornetto strawberry is still the 2nd best selling hand-held ice cream today.  In 2002, the Cornetto soft ice cream had one of the fastest and the biggest successes in Europe, winning a place as finalist at the 11th Annual Foods Awards Ceremony in Rotterdam.  In 2004, Wall’s sold 80 million Cornetto ice cream cones – which is enough to stretch from the UK to Australia.  Now to a sizable number of British consumers the alternative lyrics are more famous than the original. The adverts ran for ten years during the 1980's and 1990's. ","For those who love OREO and want it included in every other dessert dish have now got a reason to rejoice. For such Oreo-obsessed customers, FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) and popular chocolate manufacturer Mondelez India collaborated to introduce Cornetto Oreo in frozen dessert cone category in India.   Cornetto is one the world’s leading ice cream brands owned by Unilever that was launched in 1960 in Italy. Cornetto is an ice cream brand owned by HUL step down firm Kwality Walls, while Oreo is a premium cookie brand owned by Mondelez India, the maker of popular chocolates like Dairy Milk, 5 Star and Gems. Cornetto Oreo range is available across all stores at the price of Rs 60. Oreo was introduced by Mondelez India six years back and in such a short span, India has emerged among its top-five markets by volume.   Mondelez India Head, Biscuits Category, Sudhanshu Nagpal said, “Cornetto too, with its smooth creamy texture, crispy wafer cone all the way to the chocolatey tip has garnered tremendous consumer love over the years. We believe in bringing delicious moments of joy to our consumers and the Cornetto-Oreo partnership will be an exciting one.”   Himanshu Kanwar, GM at Kwality Walls at HUL said “as a brand it is our continued effort to innovate and create products that consumers love. Through this launch, we wish to give romance and love a new expression.”   Mondelez India Foods (formerly Cadbury India) is a part of global confectionery major Mondelez International. Besides chocolates, its portfolio consists of beverage brand as Tang and Bournvita. It also has Halls and Choclairs Gold under its candy portfolio. ","Great taste is in our nature! Knorr cares as much about the food you cook for your loved ones as you do. That’s why we go the extra mile to create great taste by carefully selecting ingredients, flavours and spices to give you Restaurant like food at home.  Knorr has yummy soups, delicious noodles and mouth-watering masalas in India.  The Knorr range of soups is available in 18 tasty and exciting flavours with 100% real vegetables & no added preservatives.

Spices are quintessential to Indian cooking and now with Knorr extending its expertise to masalas, restaurant like dishes such as biryani or pav bhaji can now be made at home. With an incredible blend of spices and distinctive flavours, we have launched eight masalas including Sambhar, Chana, Biryani, Chicken masala. Apart from the lip smacking taste, Knorr masalas also give your dishes perfect consistency, color & aroma. So now you can make restaurant quality red and thick pav bhaji at home. This range is ideal for passionate cooks who love cooking and making tasty dishes for their families.  At Knorr, we believe that delicious and nutritious food should be within everyone’s reach. We only use top quality ingredients and well researched preservation techniques to create a range of delicious and easy to prepare meals. We also bring this passion for quality to our quest for sustainability. This means implementing practices to source sustainably, reduce water consumption and to protect the biodiversity around our farms.  We are committed to provide food that tastes good, does good & doesn’t cost the earth. We don’t just make food, We Live it! ","Drying is one of the oldest ways to preserve food there is, going back thousands of years. It’s simple, safe and helps keep the colour, aroma and flavour of our ingredients for longer.  Not only does drying keep flavour locked in, it’s also a great alternative to using preservatives. Which makes a lot of sense – nothing is added when drying our vegetables and only the water is taken away.  As Matthias Zitterbart, one of our vegetable experts said, “The whole idea of drying a product is that you remove the water so you don’t need preservatives. In this case we are just taking straight tomato paste and putting it through a drying process and making it into a product that is just how it is, full of tomatoey goodness.”  When harvesting tomatoes, Knorr farmers will let them go thirsty for a week or so first - this increases their sweetness and reduces the amount of water that needs to be taken out. We measure the sweetness of our tomatoes with something called a Brix test – and the higher the number, the sweeter they are.  But it’s always really surprising to see just how much of a vegetable is actually made up of water. For example, we need to process 12 tons of onions for every single ton of dried onion we produce. That’s all water that won’t be diluting the taste when you’re cooking.  Sometimes nature starts off the drying process. For example, our onions are picked and left to dry in the sunshine for a few days, but once they’re peeled they’re dried and processed within a couple of hours to keep the freshness and taste in. Not all of our sustainable ingredients are dried – many are turned to paste or pulp for foods like soup or stock pots. But for our dried products, it’s reassuring to know that a method that’s thousands of years old will continue to help deliver tasty ingredients for many years to come. ","The history of Knorr is a story of passion, exploration and innovation.  In 1838, Carl Heinrich Knorr opened a factory in Heilbronn, Germany supplying chicory to the German coffee industry.  Mr. Knorr began to experiment with drying vegetables and seasonings, preserving their nutritional value and flavour. This led to the launch  of Knorr’s first dried soup range across the European continent in 1873. This progressive breakthrough led to a series of improvements in technique and development of new products.  Since 1838, our food philosophy has centered on high quality, which we maintain in every one of our products.  In 1957, flagship Knorr brands were sold in only eight countries and by the year 2000, Knorr products were sold in nearly ninety countries around the world. The same year led to an important milestone; Knorr joined the Unilever family.  Knorr was launched in India in 1996, and now we have irresistible soups, delicious noodles and flavourful masalas.  Flavours of the World  Knorr’s products are available around the world; we pride ourselves on  genuine understanding of local flavours. Our global and local understanding enables us to provide you with great tasting international favourites, helping you sample authentic flavours from cultures far and wide.  Knorr History – India  In 1996, Knorr launched Soups in India with a range of 10 flavours.  The Knorr range of soups is now available in 20 tasty and exciting flavours with 100% real vegetables and no added preservatives.  Our range of cook-up soups is available in a wide range, and has classics like Thick Tomato and Mixed Vegetables soup, as well as authentic international flavours such as Italian Mushroom and Mexican Tomato Corn.

","Unilever has launched a new soup in France that is the first to publicize a key ingredient as sustainably sourced, according to a recent announcement.  The soup will carry the label “Made with sustainably grown tomatoes” to reflect the company’s efforts over that past 15 years working with suppliers to meet its Sustainable Agriculture Code, which establishes guidelines for its suppliers and farmers to adopt sustainability practices. Tomatoes are the largest crop used in Unilever’s products, the company said.  Unilever’s Sustainable Living Plan sets goals of purchasing 100 percent of its top 13 vegetables and herbs from sustainable sources by 2015 and 100 percent of all agricultural raw materials by 2020.  Knorr recently hosted its second Sustainable Agriculture Summit with 80 of its largest global suppliers. The company discussed progress following 18 months of collaboration through the €1 million Knorr Sustainability Partnership Fund, which co-finances innovative sustainable farming projects with suppliers. So far a total of 30 projects have been financed, covering a range of sustainability issues such as biodiversity protection, water scarcity and climate change. Six Knorr suppliers also have achieved “Landmark” farm status, reflecting their cachet as sustainability innovators. ","LIPTON® AND SUSTAINABILITY Lipton® has always led the way for tea. From Sir Thomas Lipton’s innovative Lipton® tea estate, to his exciting marketing promotions—Lipton® has always been ahead of the curve.  This is especially true when it comes to sustainability. Lipton® is doing more than ever to ensure that our refreshing tea tastes great not just today, but for years to come.  WHERE IS LIPTON® TEA GROWN? Today, Lipton® touches many parts of the world. Lipton® tea is grown in estates in Kenya, Argentina and Sri Lanka. Lipton® owns tea estates in both Kenya and Tanzania. Across the world, we work with the Rainforest Alliance to ensure that our tea is sourced sustainably, and workers get a fair deal.  THE RAINFOREST ALLIANCE AND LIPTON® TEA The Rainforest Alliance is an independent organization that works with individuals, communities and companies to reduce environmental impacts and ensure sustainable livelihoods. In May 2007, our parent company, Unilever, pledged to source tea sustainably by working with the Rainforest Alliance. From 2015 onwards, 100% of our tea for Lipton® tea bags is sourced from Rainforest Alliance Certified tea gardens.  WHAT DOES THE RAINFOREST ALLIANCE DO? Rainforest Alliance certification encourages farmers to grow crops and manage estates sustainably in three ways: environmental protection, social equity and economic viability. Since none of these factors can support long-term success on its own, the Alliance helps farmers improve in all three areas. By choosing tea that’s certified by the Rainforest Alliance, you’re making a positive difference to the future. You’ll be helping to support farmers working to improve their livelihoods and those of their families, while protecting the planet for the future.  TEA FARMING AND THE USE OF PESTICIDES We are at the forefront of the industry in its work to reduce – and when possible, eliminate – the use of pesticides in farming. We do this through our global initiatives such as the Unilever Sustainable Agriculture Code.  All Lipton® tea estates are Rainforest Alliance Certified. Rainforest Alliance farms meet very stringent standards, requiring farmers to reduce their overall use of pesticides and use biological alternatives where possible. Additionally, workers on Rainforest Alliance Certified farms must receive proper training in the application of any pesticides and must only use pesticides when they are absolutely necessary to protect our beautiful crops. Trace amounts of pesticides may still be found in some of our teas, although we are continuously working to reduce those amounts as much as possible.  Our efforts are aligned with those of international authorities, including the World Health Organization. If you have any concerns, please reach out on our contact us page and we will be happy to share more information with you. ","THE HISTORY OF LIPTON® TEA Growing up in a tenement building in Glasgow, there was nothing to suggest that Sir Thomas Lipton would go on to revolutionize the future of tea. Yet before long, his publicity stunts and wacky marketing campaigns cemented his place in the history of tea. THE BEGINNING OF LIPTON® TEA HISTORY In 1890, Sir Thomas set out to buy his first tea plantations. He purchased 5,500 acres of the Dambatenne Tea Plantation in Ceylon’s high country then re-organized the plantations, making production more efficient. SIR THOMAS LIPTON’S MARKETING GENIUS Thomas Lipton was a big fan of promotional stunts. When his first 20,000 tea chests arrived in Glasgow he put on a party, complete with a brass band and bagpipe parade.  When the first Lipton® grocery store opened in Glasgow 1871, he imported the world’s largest cheese and even issued his own Lipton® currency.  By the time he shipped his first batch of tea, Thomas Lipton was a millionaire.  LOWERING THE COST OF TEA In 1893 Sir Thomas Lipton officially established the Thomas J Lipton Co.®, a tea packaging company based in Hoboken, New Jersey . He felt that tea should be a drink for everyone, not just the wealthy , so he strived to make packaging and shipping less expensive.  Instead of arriving in crates, Sir Thomas packaged his loose tea in multiple weight options. The tea was also standardized, so Lipton® customers knew exactly what to expect. THE HISTORY OF TEA BAGS Tea bags were an accidental creation by American merchant Thomas Sullivan. When sending samples of tea to his customers, he would place them in small silk bags. His customers presumed the whole bag should be steeped in water, and so the tea bag was born. Thomas Lipton was always forward thinking, and knew how important tea bags would be to his product. Lipton® was also the first tea brand to print brewing instructions on tea bag tags. LIPTON® TODAY AND THE RAINFOREST ALLIANCE Lipton® continues to innovate. In the US, 100% of our leaf tea is Rainforest Alliance Certified™. By supporting smallholder farmers, we can ensure sustainability from crop to cup. We’re also innovating when it comes to tea flavors. With one of the most varied tea ranges available, from fruity iced tea to aromatic chai, we celebrate Sir Thomas’s legacy every day. ","After half an hour of plucking tea at the Lipton Estate in Kericho, Kenya, my back is sore, my pants are soaked and my shoes are muddy. In total, my co-worker and I manage to harvest about 2.5 kilograms of acceptable-quality leaves, of which I am personally responsible for about 1 kg.  Our collection will be shipped within hours to a nearby factory, where it will be dried, cut, oxidized, taste-tested, packaged and flown to Manchester, England. My efforts would have earned me a grand total of 10 cents.  Tea plucking is not a glamorous job, but it could be worse. In fact, the management at Lipton and its parent company, Unilever, are putting a great deal of effort into maintaining responsible labour conditions for their pluckers, not to mention enforcing a host of sustainable agriculture practices.  On a recent press trip to the East African country, where Unilever owns 11 factories and acres of the ubiquitous Camellia Sinensus tea bush, a group of journalists (including myself) was given the opportunity to see first-hand how the company breeds, plants, grows, harvests and processes its tea.  “It was difficult on the first day,” says David Rono, who has been harvesting tea with Unilever for over 13 years. “My back hurt a little and I only got 10 kg. But I’m more experienced now and my body is used to it, so I can pluck up to 80 kg a day.”  Rono lives nearby with his family in a modest house provided by the company and walks to the fields each morning at sunrise. He earns between $5 and $8 a day, which is three times the average wage of agricultural employees in Kenya. A lot of his friends also live and work here, and Rono says he enjoys it.  Although most environmentalists tend to cringe or scowl upon hearing the name Unilever, the company’s tea operations are commendable and have been for some time.

","Launched in 1989, the Magnum Classic was the first hand-held ice cream aimed exclusively at adults. Its winning formula combined delectable silky ice cream and fine chocolate specially formulated to withstand temperatures as low as -40 degrees Celsius – and it soon became a hit.  Since then, the brand has grown dramatically, selling more than a billion ice creams every year. And its range includes a wealth of irresistible flavours designed to spark curiosity and tantalise the taste buds of fans around the world.  For pure pleasure seekers Ice creams smothered in rich white chocolate, sprinkled with sweet crushed almonds or drizzled with layers of caramel soon joined the Magnum range. And in recent years, the brand has delighted ice cream-lovers with innovative recipes, all made from premium ingredients and proudly carrying the Magnum stamp on every chocolate shell.  In 2003, consumers were enticed to embrace their wicked sides with Magnum’s Seven Deadly Sins collection – hedonistic flavours inspired by gluttony, sloth, greed, wrath, lust, envy and vanity. In 2005, the Five Senses range made its debut, with five limited-edition flavours inspired by aroma, touch, vision, sound and taste.  And in 2012, Magnum made dreams come true for chocolate lovers when it unveiled the mouth-watering Magnum Infinity – dark chocolate ice cream, swirled with chocolate sauce, swathed in thick Belgian chocolate and dipped in cocoa nibs.  Magnum Gold, vanilla ice cream laced with salted caramel in a glistening golden chocolate shell, made its debut the same year. It followed this the next year with the Five Kisses collection - a range inspired by indulgent desserts such as crème brûlée, chocolate gateaux and tiramisu. Then in 2014 Magnum celebrated its 25th anniversary with celebrations all over the world and the launch of the Magnum Silver.  Chocolate that changes lives While it's spent a quarter-century devoted to the pursuit of pleasure, Magnum also has a clear commitment to sourcing its chocolate ethically, as part of Unilever's Sustainable Living Plan.  Magnum has pledged to source 100% of its cocoa from Rainforest Alliance-certified farms by 2015, which will help create a brighter future for farmers in West Africa.  In return for their delicious cocoa, Magnum will provide farmers with fair, sustainable incomes, training in how to respect their environment and improved access to education for their children. ","Unilever has expanded its Magnum product line in the US with the release of Magnum ice cream tubs, which feature a Belgian chocolate shell encasing the ice cream.  The Magnum Tubs range is available in four flavours: Milk chocolate vanilla, dark chocolate raspberry, milk chocolate hazelnut, and white chocolate vanilla.  Each flavour comes with a chocolate shell lining the sides of the tub which consumers will break into, creating a mix of chocolate shards and ice cream.  Every tub contains vanilla ice cream and Belgian chocolate, the same ingredients found in a Magnum Ice Cream Bar but contained in a scoopable format.  Bruno Francisco, marketing director of ice cream at Unilever said: “Magnum Tubs offer a new, multisensory way to enjoy Magnum Ice Cream that is unlike anything available in the category today.  “It is truly a revolutionary ice cream experience that our fans are going to love.”  The tubs are available now from select retailers and will go on sale nationwide in February, with a suggested price of$5.49. ","The ice cream today known as Magnum was developed in Belgium at the Ola laboratory (Baasrode) in cooperation with the Belgian chocolate producer Callebaut and released in Germany in January 1989 as an upmarket ice cream for the existing Nogger brand. It was originally manufactured by Frisko in Denmark.[1] The original Magnum (later rebranded as Magnum Classic) consisted of a thick bar of vanilla ice cream on a stick, with a chocolate coating. As there was no real chocolate which could stand the temperature of −40 degrees Celsius, an ad hoc chocolate had to be developed.[2] The original Magnum had a weight of 86 grams and a volume of 120 mL)[citation needed]. The former factory in Aarhus, Denmark, is transformed into apartments, shops and a fitness centre, and is named Friskohus (The Frisko House) after the ice cream company brand[3] The Frisko brand still used in Denmark.  The company also started selling Magnum ice cream cones in 1994 and an ice cream sandwich in 2002.  Starting in 1992, the company added Magnum Almond, Double Chocolate, and White amongst other flavours. In 2002, Magnum branched into frozen yogurt with their raspberry fruit swirl covered in milk chocolate.Moments were introduced which were bite-size ice cream treats with caramel, chocolate, or hazelnut centres, followed later in the year by mini, crunchy (with almonds), and light. Late 2002 saw the launch of Magnum Intense, a chocolate truffle center enveloped in ice cream and covered with chocolate, and the limited edition 7 Deadly Sins series of ice creams, whose flavours were named after the seven deadly sins. Sins was followed by another limited edition range in 2005 in which each flavour was named after one of the senses: Magnum Aroma, Magnum Touch, Magnum Sound, Magnum Taste, and Magnum Sight.  In 2003, Streets, the brand under which Magnum is sold in Australia and New Zealand, brought out a limited edition series of ice creams known as The Sixties Nine featuring sixties-related names: John Lemon, Wood Choc, Jami Hendrix, ChocWork Orange, Peace ManGO, Cinnaman on the Moon, Cherry Guevara, Candy Warhol and Guava Lamp. Consumers who collected nine of these ice cream sticks could send them off to gain a free Magnum T-shirt. The extreme popularity of the ChocWork Orange resulted in Streets selling it as the Chocolate Orange Magnum for some time after the remainder of the range was discontinued. Similarly, the Peppermint Envy of the Seven Deadly Sins range became Peppermint and is still available in Australia today.  In 2008, Magnum brought out new variants in the UK—Mayan Mystica, a chocolate ice cream Magnum blended with cinnamon, nutmeg and honey flavours; and Magnum Minis available in a variety of flavours. Eva Longoria was the face of Magnum in 2008. Also in 2008, Josh Holloway, from television's Lost, was selected as the first male spokesperson of Magnum in Turkey. Benicio del Toro and Caroline Correa starred in a television commercial for Magnum Gold, directed by Bryan Singer.

Key Facts Unilever is the world's biggest ice cream manufacturer, operating under the Heartbrand And Kwality Wall’s is present in India since 1993. Heartbrand products are sold in more than 40 countries worldwide. Also sold as Algida in Italy & Turkey, Langnese in Germany, Kibon in Brazil, Streets in Australia and Ola in the Netherlands. ","Kwality Walls is the company of Hindustan Unilever, the arm of Unilever in India. It is an amalgamated brand name created out of two previously separate independent companies that Unilever took over: Kwality of India and Wall's of Great Britain. Kwality Wall's frozen desserts do not contain milk products, but vegetable fat/oil, and hence cannot be termed as ice-cream.  History Kwality, the original Indian company, was founded in 1956, and was the first in the region to import machinery for the mass production and sale of ice cream on a commercial scale. In 1995, in view of the growth potential of the frozen confections market, Kwality entered into an agreement with Lever, and has since been known by its current umbrella name. At the same time, other brands acquired by Hindustan Unilever, such as Gaylord-Milkfood, were phased out in favour of promoting the Kwality Wall's brand. This arrangement allows for local production and sale of Wall's products that are popular in its home market, such as the Cornetto cone, and to create local variations on others, such as the Feast Jaljeera Blast. Kwality Wall's was ranked 464th among India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2012, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory. In the Brand Trust Report 2013, Kwality Wall's was ranked 632nd among India's most trusted brands and subsequently, according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, Kwality Wall's was ranked 382nd among India's most trusted brands.[1]  In August 2013, Kwality Wall's extended to Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei and Nepal. ","BRU Gold is a 100% coffee, which promises to completely invigorate your senses with its distinct taste and aroma. The coffee is made of a fine blend of Robusta and Arabica beans that lend their tasteful and aromatic notes to the coffee, and provide a rich mouthful of flavour. Blending in a little more excitement to the BRU Gold experience, the brand announces the launch of its new campaignwith brand ambassadors Sidharth Malhotra and Anushka Sharma.  In today’s day and age, we notice, people compromise family and friends due to mounting time pressures, stress at work and the daily rut of life. But when one pauses and takes some time out to spend quality time with their loved ones, they actually end up doing much more than the regular. This might sound small, but it has a monumental effect on our existing relationships. With time, we all forget to put in that extra bit in our relationship that we cherish the most, thinking it doesn’t need any more work. That is exactly where we go wrong and end up weakening that ‘special’ bond with our close ones.Bru Gold’s new marketing campaign is all about creating a moment to strengthen these close relationships. Therefore the brand beautifully captures this essence in the new tagline “Tasty Bru gold ka waqt nikaliye aur rishton mein swad gholiye“  Announcing this development, Pragya Sharma, ‎Category Head, Coffee,Hindustan Unilever Limited said, “With coffee fast catching on as a social drink among the current generation of consumers, BRU’s  philosophy of “conversations over a cup of coffee help us to enrich those relationships that matter most to us” makes the brand absolutely relevant in today’s context. The brand believes that life should be full of lively moments spent with dear ones and wanted to associate with brand ambassadors that truly embody this philosophy. SidharthandAnushka have a good connect with the audience and they endorse the core values that BRU stands for and we are delighted to associate with them for our forthcoming campaigns.”  Actor Sidharth Malhotra, the brand’s new ambassador said, “I’m glad to associate with BRU, because I think it is a great brand, and is really loved by the people. BRU knows the Indian palate really well and are known for their aromatic and great tasting coffees. I’m excited to be part of this brand, especially because it attaches a lot of importance to relationships and believes in taking that little extra effort and do more for our loved ones, which is extremely relevant for our generation.”  Anushka Sharma adds, “Coffee is the ultimate stress buster for me and I need my cup of coffee in the morning to kick start my day. This explains why it feels great to be associated with a brand like BRU, undoubtedly they understand coffee the best. This is my third campaign for BRU Gold coffee and looking forward towards the same.”  So go ahead, take that small step, make that little gesture of doing a little more and enrich relationships. ","Brooke Bond & Company was founded by Arthur Brooke who was born at 6 George Street, Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, England in 1845. He opened his first tea shop in 1869[1] at 23 Market Street, Manchester. Arthur Brooke chose the name because it was his 'bond' to customers to provide a quality tea, hence Brooke Bond. The firm expanded into wholesale tea sales in the 1870s.[1]  In 1903, Brooke Bond launched Red Label in India.[2]  The company opened a packing factory in Goulston Street, Stepney, London in 1911.[3]  Brooke Bond's most famous brand is PG Tips, launched in 1930.[4] By 1957, Brooke Bond was probably the largest tea company in the world, with one third share of both the British and Indian tea markets.[5]  The company merged with Liebig in 1968, becoming Brooke Bond Liebig, which was acquired by Unilever in 1984. The Brooke Bond name has since been significantly decreased by Unilever, however it is possible to still buy boxes of 'Brooke Bond Tea Co' tea in the UK, but not in supermarkets. Gold Crown Foods Ltd was licensed by Unilever to use the Brooke Bond name for the Brooke Bond 'D' and Brooke Bond Choicest brands.[6] Today, the licence for D Tea is held by Typhoo, who sell it through their website – it has identical packaging to before minus the words 'Brooke Bond'. It is also regularly sold across Britain in Poundland stores. The Brooke Bond brand is still used in other countries, especially in India. In Pakistan, Brooke Bond Supreme is the number-one-selling tea brand. Unilever markets it as being stronger than its Lipton Yellow Label blend.  In North America Brooke Bond's primary product was Red Rose Tea. Red Rose is still sold by Unilever in Canada, but in the United States is now marketed by Redco Foods.  The Brooke Bond factory is at Trafford Park near Manchester.[4]  Brands and origins Brooke Bond Taj Mahal tea leaves are grown in estates of Upper Assam, Darjeeling and Tripura. It grows on the northern banks of the great Brahmaputra, which floods its banks every monsoon, creating a rich, humid soil. There is plentiful rain in the monsoon and humidity lasts through the year. The soil and weather together give Assam Tea its 'terroir' – a dark red brew, a strong malty flavor and deep body.  Brooke Bond Red Label, the Indian blend, is made in tea manufacturing units of Assam, Coochbehar, Darjeeling and some parts of Meghalaya. The manufacturing process of tea includes the stages of withering (leaving tea leaves to dry), rolling/cutting (through which complex series of chemical changes known as oxidation are initiated), drying and then grading into sizes.  Brooke Bond Taaza is made of High Quality fresh Green Tea Leaves.  Brooke Bond Supreme is imported to Pakistan, made from Kenyan tea leaves. ","New Delhi:In a country where disability and mental health issues are still a stigma, Brooke Bond Red Label, the 110-year old tea brand from Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s (HUL) stable, is stirring a conversation on disability through music. Continuing its quest to break stereotypes, the brand has launched the second edition of ‘Six Pack Band’ campaign featuring differently abled children highlighting the many myths associated with autism.  Aptly titled ‘Issphesal 6’, the band comprises three girls and three boys between the ages of 13 and 18. Although the band members deal with varying challenges from learning difficulties to autism, the music video manages to capture their spirit.  With a history of socially inclusive advertising, Red Label in the first edition of Six Pack Band campaign, created a viral music video on India’s first transgender band https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blvOBnSRfVc which not only stood out for its theme of inclusion but also managed to bag the highest creative recognition in the ad world, the Cannes Grand Prix.  The socially inclusive advertising journey of Red Label started in 2014 when it broke a campaign on how a reluctant Hindu couple locked out of its house is invited by their Muslim neighbour for a cup of tea which acts as an ice breaker. The second campaign Surprise Visit talked about a rather socially awkward topic of live-in relationship and the most recent campaign depicted the social alienation faced by the protagonist suffering from Alzheimer’s.  “Brooke Bond Red Label’s purpose is to help people find common ground which makes the world a more welcoming place. We see this (6 Pack Band 2.0 campaign) as a delightful way to urge people to shed ignorance and inhibition and learn to accept everyone as they are irrespective of any ability or disability,” said Shiva Krishnamurthy, general manager - beverages, Hindustan Unilever.  K.V. Sridhar, founder of creative outfit Hyper Collective said that since product benefits have become commoditised, only those brands that propagate human values will strike an emotional connect with consumers. “By creating awareness around differently abled people Red Label comes across as an empathetic brand which cares for such people and consumers like such brands,” he said.  The Red Label video is conceived and produced by Ashish Patil, head of Y-Films the youth film wing of Yash Raj Films and curated by composer Shameer Tandon. The band hopes to break social barriers and pave the way for an inclusive society, sparking a conversation during the ongoing World Autism month. The title track will be followed by a launch of six songs as a part of the ‘Issphesal’ album, over a period of six months.  “Being a special needs parent myself (father of one of the band members), the theme of mental health and disability is extremely close to my heart. In India, people with mental disability often face social alienation and discrimination because of the lack of awareness about such diseases which we aim to change,” said Patil. ","The Brooke Bond Taj Mahal Tea House is a tea house and restaurant owned and operated by Hindustan Unilever Limited that is located in Bandra, West Mumbai, India.[1][2] It opened for business in September 2015.[2] The establishment is 3,500 square feet in size and seats around 80 patrons.[1][3] It is Hindustan Unilever's first tea restaurant business.[1] The establishment was designed by brothers Ayaz Basrai and Zameer Basrai, both from Bandra The Brooke Bond Taj Mahal Tea House is associated with and serves Brooke Bond Taj Mahal and other tea products, totaling over 40 tea varieties.[1] Teas served include milk teas, iced teas, chai teas and lattes, tea lemonades and tea smoothies.[3][4] Teas are served with complementary shortcrust cookies and raisin and oat biscuits.[3]  The foods were developed by French chef Gregory Bazire, with a focus upon complementing the teas.[1] The restaurant has a tea-pairing menu that is always available, and also provides traditional tea service, breakfast, lunch and dinner menus and service.[1][3][4] The tea house also provides tea tasting sessions.[3] Dishes include waffles, Eggs Benedict, idli burgers, akuri, ragi dhokla, chicken dishes, tortellini, sandwiches, soups, salads and various desserts, among others.[3][5] ","Bru Coffee is a power brand that is owned by its parent company Hindustan Unilever.

","Pureit is the world’s most advanced range of in-home water purifiers. Pureit is breakthrough innovation designed by Hindustan Unilever and it provides complete protection from all water-borne diseases, unmatched convenience and affordability.  In the developing world, most of all diseases are water-related - a major cause for this is the poor quality of drinking water. The magnitude of the problem can be seen from the fact that diarrheal disease alone leads to 2.5 billion episodes and 1.5 million child mortalities every year.  Boiling water, as a means of purification, is expensive, energy-intensive, and cumbersome. Available storage and candle-based filters do not ensure safety from harmful germs. Given this context, Unilever embarked on a mission to provide safe and affordable drinking water through in-home water purification.  Unilever scientists have worked for many years to come up with a range of technological breakthroughs that have led to the creation of ‘Pureit’ a unique offering by Unilever.

","Hindustan Unilever has entered the surface cleaning market with Cif. Here’s how it fits into the company’s strategy  Hindustan Unilever has faced several challenges in the recent past. Nimble-footed rivals have nibbled market share, commodity prices have been volatile and consumers have resorted to down-trading.   But Hindustan Unilever has its strategy ready. To begin with, it has begun a state-wise strategy that deploys only relevant products in a given state or district. This means the supply chain is now more efficient. It has taken corrective steps on the pricing front too. Rivals can no longer flog their lower prices. Equally important is the company’s strategy of increasing the speed of innovations and launches.  Thus, in June this year, it decided to enter the surface cleaning space by bringing in its international brand, Cif, to the country. Cif is the first cream-based cleaning brand in the world and is the largest household care brand in Europe and South Africa. In India, Cif has been priced at Rs 53 for 270 ml.  The surface cleaning market is small in India but it is growing at a fast pace. But that’s just one way of looking at it. the strategist explores how Cif fits in with the overall strategy of Hindustan Unilever and how it executed the launch.  Specialist cleaner At present, the overall household cleaning care category stands at Rs 1,240 crore. Out of this, utensil cleaners make up Rs 950 crore and surface cleaners the rest. The market for surface cleaners has three segments: Toilet cleaners (Rs 180 crore), floor cleaners (Rs 75 crore) and specialist surface cleaners (Rs 35 crore). Cif fits into the last category which is growing at over 24 per cent per annum.  Hindustan Unilever has had a strong presence in utensil cleaners, toilet cleaners and floor cleaners with brands like Vim and Domex. With these brands, it has a 49 per cent share of the household cleaning care market. “We felt that we were not represented in the small specialist surface cleaner category and it’s important we are present there as the category is growing rapidly,” says Hindustan Unilever Vice-president (home care and skin cleansing) Sudhanshu Vats.  But what prompted the company to launch the four-decade old brand now? “Timing is very important,” says Vats. In the last few years, the construction of new homes has happened at a blistering pace and the average age of buying a home considerably down. “We find the quality of consumers and surfaces have gotten more sophisticated and these surfaces need specialist products,” he adds. Thus, the company introduced Cif.  Moreover, with more and more women working there was the need for a contemporary product for cleaning surfaces at home. So far, proxy products like dish wash bars and liquids were being used for this work and there was no product to address this need. “Obviously a product like this is not required on mosaic floors or at a time when women stayed at home,” Vats points out.  For its part, the company did a detailed study using its internal tracker called Living Standards Measure or LSM to confirm what it felt. LSM can range anywhere between one and eighteen — a higher score shows a higher living standard. On that scale, India is a LSM 3 nation. Typically, a product like Cif needs the market to score five or above. Still, the company felt the Indian market was ready for Cif.  Is there a market? In the company’s assessment, about ten per cent of Indian households could buy Cif. This makes it a market of over 100 million people for the brand. This is still well above the population of many Western European nations. To ascertain this, marketers at the company went door to door to observe the living standards of the urban population. “Twenty years ago, we wouldn’t have been able to launch a product like this but today things are different,” says Vats.  Nikhil Vora, an analyst with IDFC-SSKI Securities, agrees: “Products like this make sense as the potential for home products is very good.” However, the downside, as Vora points out, is that the category is fairly small and only relevant to the urban population. “I suppose the idea would be to be a first mover in this high growth segment. But Hindustan Unilever will have to keep feeding it with investments till the brand gains traction,” he explains.  With that in mind, Hindustan Unilever has deployed a 360-degree campaign for Cif. It has bombarded television and radio with advertisements. Additionally, demonstrations are being carried out across malls and modern trade.  However, there’s one area of concern for the company. By and large, consumers in India are known to be averse to gel-based or cream-based products as the format is associated with gentleness and wastage. “That’s true, that’s why our proposition is tough cleaning with care,” says Vats. To suit that, the company’s communication is tweaked to show that one drop is enough and lasts longer as well.  But the ride isn’t going to be smooth for Hindustan Unilever. Rivals too have their eye on the small surface cleaning market. Dabur’s Dazzl, Reckitt Benckiser’s Easy Off Bang and SC Johnson’s Mr Muscle are all set to fight Cif tooth and nail in this space. ","BRAND HEALTH CHECK: Jif - Is loyalty for Jif behind the name or product? Jif is rebranding in the UK to its global name of Cif. But how will the household cleaning brand ensure its UK consumers continue to pick up the product, asks Cordelia Brabbs They've done it to chocolate (Marathon/Snickers), they've done it to sweets (Opal Fruits/Starburst), they've done it to cosmetics (Oil of Ulay/Olay), they've tried to do it to cereal (Coco Pops/Choco Krispies). Now they're doing it to household cleaning products.    inShare They've done it to chocolate (Marathon/Snickers), they've done it to sweets (Opal Fruits/Starburst), they've done it to cosmetics (Oil of Ulay/Olay), they've tried to do it to cereal (Coco Pops/Choco Krispies). Now they're doing it to household cleaning products.  Last week, Lever Brothers announced that cleaners' favourite Jif is to be rebranded as Cif in the UK, in alignment with its global moniker.  Of the 60 countries in which the dirt-buster is sold, 39 know it as Cif - in most cases because 'c' is easier to pronounce in the local tongue than 'j'.  Over pounds 2m is being spent on the relaunch, covering new packaging and a TV and press campaign by Lowe Lintas.  Launched in the UK in 1974, Jif now has a portfolio of creams, mousses, and bath and shower spray products, and launched a Mint Fizz mousse variant in August.  Last year, Jif Cream Lemon ranked as the fifth best-selling household cleaning brand in the UK, and its Bathroom Spray was eighth (Taylor Nelson Sofres). Its key rivals are Procter & Gamble's Flash, and Johnson Wax's Mr Muscle.   This year has already seen Lever reposition Jif to attract a younger female audience, its key tactic being the launch of a web site that lets visitors vote for the man they'd most like to see pictured naked in a bath.  But will the change to Cif do anything to boost the brand? When Kellogg attempted to change its Coco Pops brand to Choco Krispies, there was an outcry, and Kellogg resorted to a public vote, which asked for it to be changed back. Will Cif receive a similar reaction?  We asked Nick Alford, managing director of Banks Hoggins O'Shea, who has worked on SC Johnson Wax's Toilet Duck, Pledge and Mr Muscle brands; and Michael Levy, managing director of innovations specialist CLK, which has worked on several brand-naming projects.

Together with another component of the category, which is household, home care is enabling HUL to bring in new consumers in its fold at the very base level, while also adding brands at the top end.  This quarter HUL saw strong growth in premium laundry. Surf, HUL’s largest brand maintained volume-led growth momentum.  “Laundry has been a great story of transformation and change,” says Priya Nair, Executive Director, Home Care, HUL. We have had a fundamental transformation in the portfolio itself and led premiumisation in the category. Detergents in India are ubiquitous. Value creation in a highly penetrated category like detergents will come from upgradation from mass products,” explains Nair.   Changing Behaviour  In a country where consumers have rising aspirations, HUL’s brand Surf Excel offered consumers higher order benefits and also launched new formats in the category such as detergent liquids. It also created the fabric softener category with brand Comfort.  More recently, HUL used technology to bring out its purpose-driven philosophy with Rin. The organisation has developed a product technology that halves the water that is used in the rinsing process. “New Rin gives consumers dazzling bright clothes while reducing the water consumption, which is so relevant in a water scarce country like ours,” says Nair. “With products like Rin, we will impact the water consumption not just in our supply chain but also in the end consumer use, which is a significant portion of our overall footprint of water,” Nair points out.  Both the market dynamics and the consumers in India are changing. Much effort in the country is being made towards building toilets but the real challenge is in getting people to use them. “The work we do as Unilever leads to building categories, and this requires behaviour change. As more toilets are built, there are more surfaces to clean, and this will have a direct impact on our brands. Our focus is on creating solutions that encourage consumers to use toilets. The more you observe this space, the more growth opportunities are visible,” says Nair. The Message In The Brand  A recent example would be our newest Comfort ad, where a mother is shown with her son and daughter, after she notices that they are conditioned to assume that laundry would be something that the daughter will have to learn. By going beyond just washing to conditioning clothes using the fabric softener, she astutely changes her son’s thinking by saying that both the daughter and the son need to learn the washing process. The message, ‘chota step, badi baat’ implies that one extra step in using Comfort can give great benefit in washing, and that one small lesson from the mother, asking the son to learn this, is a big step towards impacting the social conditioning on gender.”  Applying USLP In Home Care  Given the scale and complexity of water, sanitation and hygiene challenges in India, it is imperative that all stakeholders come together to make a meaningful difference. HUL’s partnerships with several stakeholders aim to leverage the power of collective action to realise the Swachh Bharat vision. This will also enable India to contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.  Over 130 million people have been reached through HUL’s water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) initiatives. HUL’s WASH initiatives are spearheaded by its brands Lifebuoy, Pureit and Domex. Lifebuoy handwashing behaviour change initiatives help in promoting the benefits of handwashing with soap at key times during the day and encouraging people to sustain good handwashing behaviours. Till date, HUL has reached over 63 million people in India. Pureit water purifiers have been working towards making safe drinking water accessible and affordable. In India, Pureit has provided over 74 billion litres of safe drinking water till date. Domex Toilet Academy (DTA) is a market-based entrepreneurial model launched by HUL in 2014. Currently operational in Bihar, the DTA programme trains entrepreneurs and masons to help build and maintain toilets; provides access to micro-financing and creates demand for sanitation in low-income households. So far, over a lakh toilets have been built, benefitting over 6 lakh people.  The flagship ‘Swachh Aadat Swachh Bharat’ programme is in line with the government’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission) and aims to promote good health and hygiene practices by stressing the need to adopt three simple good habits: 1) Washing hands with soap five times a day; 2) Using a toilet for defecation and keeping it clean; and 3) Adopting safe drinking water practices.

","Active Wheel's mobile campaign a huge success 23-08-2012  What started as a test pilot for building a low cost mobile activation model for media-dark geographies has turned out to be one of the biggest mobile activations ever done for HUL.  Pilot phase Replace this image Related brands Cif logo Cif Comfort logo Comfort Active Wheel logo Active Wheel In December 2011, our detergent brand Active Wheel advertised the number 1800-3000-1599 on All India Radio in U.P. & Bihar asking listeners to give a missed call. After giving a missed call consumers got an auto generated call from a series of numbers and got to hear snippets of humourous conversations between a husband and wife. This pilot got positive feedback from consumers and was a huge success!  A total of eight Instant Voice Responses lines were used in the pilot phase of the campaign; so every time the customer gave a missed call - he heard a new IVR till he called the 9th time. The result was extremely positive. The brand got a total of 3.2 Lakh Missed Calls from 28,000 unique numbers in just four weeks  Phase one of the campaign With the success of the pilot, Active Wheel increased the number of IVR’s to 30 and launched the first phase of this campaign in UP and Bihar from January 2012 to March 2012.  To support this mobile activation, Wheel also leveraged other media to spread the word including: direct IVR call in, SMS, print, radio, POS saliency in rural and our Khushiyon Ki Doli initiative.  Content was also customised for each state. For example: Bhojpuri language was used for Bihar and Hindi for UP.  The results The results out of this campaign have been very encouraging. After three months of the launching the full campaign in UP and Bihar, more than 5 million missed calls were received from 7.7 Lakh unique numbers.  What are you waiting for! Call on 1800-3000-1599*. ‘Missed Call Dijiye, Muskurate rahiye.’ *Please note if your no is on DND, you will not receive any call ","Consumer markets in the developing world are an enormous but still-untapped opportunity for companies seeking new sources of growth. Within that group is an even more overlooked opportunity: the rural consumer.  By its sheer size, it has huge potential. Worldwide, there are 3.4 billion rural consumers and about 3 billion of them live in developing countries in Asia and Africa. They are not all poor; in many countries, a rural middle class is emerging or expanding. Technology is making it easier to connect with rural consumers in so-called media dark areas.  The challenges – market development, product design, logistics, communication — deter many companies from even considering rural markets in developing countries. But some companies have what I call rural DNA – the ability to recognize the rural opportunity and to develop innovations to tap those markets along with their urban markets.  While researching my new book, Rise of Rural Consumers in Developing Countries, I conducted interviews with executives at both multinational and local firms, and talked with and observed rural consumers in the 10 countries with the largest rural populations. Seven of these are in Asia (India, China, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Vietnam) and three are in Africa (Ethiopia, Nigeria and Egypt). I also visited Thailand, Myanmar, and Bhutan, which also have considerable rural populations.  One of the standouts was Unilever. Particularly in Asia, Unilever has pioneered a number of innovations that it has exported to other regions in its focus on addressing rural market opportunities.  Tap women to power sales With its Shakti initiative, Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) pioneered the concept of training local women as rural sales agents who sell Unilever products door to door in their communities. As of 2015, the initiative had grown to 70,000 sales agents serving 165,000 Indian villages, and HUL had equipped them with smartphone apps to help them manage inventory and other aspects of their business. The company has created variations in Bangladesh, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Egypt, and other countries.  In Pakistan, Unilever took the concept to a new level, training hundreds of village women as beauticians, working out of their homes. During a three-month program, the women, called Guddi Bajis, or “good sisters,” learn to apply makeup, shampoo hair, and provide other beauty services, as well as how to sell Unilever products to their customers. They charge for their services and earn commissions on those sales as well as points toward incentives such as salon tables or mirrors.  Ehsan Malik, former chairman and CEO of Unilever Pakistan told me that underlying the initiative is research showing that rural women have a high interest in beauty but little access to advice or products. The Guddi Bajis provide that access and become brand ambassadors for Unilever products. The initiative also provides incomes for women who have few opportunities to make money and cannot freely travel outside of their homes. The market potential is significant: 4.5 million women in 5,000 villages, Unilever told me.  Find grassroots distribution strategies The Philippines is a nation of small retailers. About 95% of the 1 million retail locations are small variety shops, called sari-sari stores. Despite their small size, some of the stores sell as many as 200 different items. Nielsen has estimated they account for 36% of the country’s fast-moving consumer goods sales.  Distributing goods to these mom-and-pop operations would be complicated and expensive, so about six years ago, Unilever landed on an idea: recruit some of the larger stores to do double duty as sub-distributors. At one such store I visited in Rizal province, southeast of Manila, the owner had purchased two motorized tricycles to make deliveries. In another, the store was a distribution point for sari-sari shopkeepers from a nearby island.  Owners of the superstores, as they are called, get discounts on Unilever products, while the sari-sari stores get better access to more Unilever brands. The superstores also serve as venues for activations, called fiestas, which combine product demonstrations and giveaways with games and entertainment. Unilever organizes about 500 fiestas a year, and said sales of highlighted brands typically jump 30-80% during fiesta weeks.  Unilever told me that the initiative had doubled its rural coverage in the Philippines while also reducing distribution costs. They use other direct-distribution models in other countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh and India to increase the rural reach of its brands.   Offer services rural consumers need The blue star on the sign outside a shop in a Thai village was more than a decoration. It signaled to customers that they would be entering a “store with star quality.” That means they’d not only find attractive displays and a wide assortment of Unilever products, but extra services such as community washing machines and “food corners” for breakfast or snacks.  Unilever Thailand launched what it calls the Platinum store initiative to bring an urban shopping experience to rural customers – an alternative to typical rural stores with limited offerings. Unilever helps design the layouts, develops promotions, and brings in partner companies for services such as ATMs. The stores must meet certain requirements, including assuring high-visibility displays for Unilever products. The Platinum stores get more customer traffic and revenue.  The initiative has helped Unilever fend off rivals such as 7-Eleven, which has been expanding rapidly in urban areas. Sales at Platinum stores were expanding at triple the rate of the channel overall, managers told me during my visit.  Create new channels for advertising One challenge in tapping the rural market is how to reach consumers in remote areas with limited electricity and little access to mass media.  In India, Hindustan Unilever has used mobile technology to create audio entertainment for rural areas, adapting a common practice among frugal cellphone users – the missed call. To conserve talk time, mobile phone users dial a number, then hang up before they are charged, although the other person can see who called. It’s a way of letting someone know you want to reach them. In 2011, HUL exploited the practice in a pilot promotion for its Active Wheel detergent in some of India’s poorest and most rural areas. People were asked to call a number that cut off after two rings, so it cost them nothing. An automatic free callback provided some comic dialogue from Bollywood star Salman Khan and ads for Wheel. In four months, HUL got 16 million calls and Wheel sales tripled in the region.  HUL expanded the concept to offer 18-minute blocks of audio entertainment interspersed with ads for Unilever brands. The cost is less than 2 cents per impression. By 2015, it had grown to 35 million subscribers and was adding 25,000 a day. Unilever was planning to create versions in Pakistan, Bangladesh and some African countries.  Design products (and set prices) for rural consumers Years ago, HUL pioneered the use of low-cost, single-use packets to make its products affordable for lower-income consumers who often shop daily for necessities (think of a ketchup packet, but filled with soap). Now these packets are ubiquitous in developing countries around the world. HUL itself sells 27 billion sachets a year.  In the Philippines, they turned out to be the answer to increasing rural sales of the company’s Rexona deodorant.  Unilever faced a tough challenge: Only half of Filipinos buy deodorant regularly, and standard package sizes were too pricey for rural consumers. To lower the price, the company first tried a small size of Rexona in stick form. The ministicks cost 35 cents, but that was not cheap enough for rural consumers. Then Unilever developed a cream version in a single-use-sized packet that cost about 10 cents.  That was the winning formula: Even the smallest mom-and-pop shops began stocking them, and Rexona cream overtook the roll-on version as the product’s biggest seller. With a push from Rexona, deodorant penetration nationwide doubled to about 60 percent.  Help managers adopt a rural mindset Underlying HUL’s success in rural India is a program that requires managers to spend a month during their first year living in a village. They see how rural consumers live, and get a firsthand perspective on their needs and aspirations. That personal experience gives them insights that they could never gain from reading reports or conventional market visits. Several HUL executives told me they credited their success in part to that program.  These ten countries in Asia and Africa host almost two-thirds of the world’s rural population, 2.2 billion inhabitants. Because of government interventions, remittances from rural migrants, and works of NGOs and social organizations in developing better farming and sustainable living skills, these rural markets present a huge, global opportunity. Accelerated penetration of mobile phones, internet, and satellite TV is making these rural consumers aware of the product and service options that they aspire to have for themselves and their families. Urban markets are becoming saturated – competition there is growing ever-more fierce. Forward-looking companies like Unilever cultivate an inclusive growth strategy that considers rural consumers as part of their plans for growth. ","Domex Toilet Academy - Improving sanitation practices in India Approximately 792 million Indians live without improved sanitation, of which, some 597 million people continue to defecate in the open .These statistics clearly show that sanitation conditions in India need improvement. In 2013, Domex, the leading toilet cleaner brand of Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), announced the launch of Domex Toilet Academy (DTA) to mark the occasion of World Toilet Day (celebrated on 19th November every year). Project Through the DTA, toilets are made accessible and affordable, while promoting the benefits of clean toilets and good hygiene. The objective of the programme is to reduce the incidence of open defecation and improve proper sanitation thereby promoting preventive healthcare.  DTA programme trains local micro-entrepreneurs who help execute the project in their local communities by supplying and building toilets. In this way, the DTA programme aims to create a positive impact on the health and well-being of the community whilst stimulating the local economy.  The Academy provides business skills and training to local entrepreneurs and masons to supply toilets to their local communities thus providing jobs while at the same time promoting the importance of safe and hygienic sanitation practices in local communities.  Impact Five DTAs are currently operating in Maharashtra, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh. Since 2014, the programme has reached out to over 15,000 people by building over 3,000 toilets in villages across Odisha, Maharashtra and activities have expanded to Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The programme has also trained more than 100 local entrepreneurs to sell and maintain toilets so far. ","Domex innovates to make sanitation accessible 18-11-2017  Millions of households lack basic sanitation facilities. Hindustan Unilever Limited’s (HUL) toilet cleaning brand Domex is working towards addressing this challenge. In a first of its kind innovation, Domex has introduced toilet cleaning powder at an affordable price point for consumers at the bottom of the pyramid.  Domex innovates to make sanitation accessible Related brands Cif logo Cif Comfort logo Comfort Active Wheel logo Active Wheel Related Stories Domex launches Toilet Academy Domex launches Toilet Academy With only 58% of the country’s 263 million households having a toilet, a massive toilet building programme is underway as part of the Government of India’s Swachh Bharat (Clean India) campaign. Almost 100 million new homes will be adopting a toilet by 2019. Most of these will be for low-income families. And all of them will need a low-cost cleaning solution.  In India, branded toilet cleaners are both expensive and an underpenetrated category. The most common proxy product is detergent powder. This may be reasonably good at cleaning, but it isn’t effective at killing germs or tackling the biggest unaddressed problem: malodour.  … an entirely new format Which is why we launched Domex Toilet Cleaning Powder at less than half the cost of other cleaning products. This was developed as a powder so the format would be familiar – to those who use detergent as a proxy – and designed especially for squat toilets, which are in 90% of homes. It is also the only cleaner on the market that delivers freshness as well as germ-killing power.  As Priya Nair our Executive Director, Home Care, explains: “Domex has first-mover advantage in a market where people still use proxies to clean their toilets. Hindustan Unilever has a history of bringing to market consumer-relevant and affordable innovations. With Swachh Bharat, we are seeing an increase in the number of toilets being built in India, but there is still a void when it comes to affordable cleaning solutions.”  Launched in the state of Andhra Pradesh, as a test market, in March 2017, the product has received an encouraging response from consumers. If the pilot is successful, the plan is to expand into other states.  At HUL, we believe that a clean and safe toilet is a basic right. Through our brands and products, we aim to improve health and hygiene of our consumers. This affordable innovation is a step in that direction. ","Domex raises awareness about toilet hygiene 14-02-2011  Aims to clean 2000 toilets across India within two weeks.  As part of this campaign Domexhas launched a new TVC. The TVC hasa toll-free number on which viewers can call to requestforcleaning of any dirty toilet in their vicinity - be it apublic toilet at apark, school, or any other public place. The Domex-Squad,ateam for implementing this hygiene drive, is then activated and takes the responsibility of cleaning the toilet. The Domex-Squad will take down all the requests till February 28 th and the cleaning process is scheduled from March 15th to 31st. Domex is the only brand which has sodium hypochlorite an ingredient which has the properties to kill germs. This ingredient has been endorsed by the WHO - whenever there is an epidemic or any major illness.  Domex from HUL is one of the world’s best-selling, most effective toilet cleaners. It is a thick bleach product and contains sodium hypochlorite, the most effective chemical compound able to kill all types of pathogens (or germs), including all known bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. It has been sold for more than 80 years.  Today, Domex is sold in 35 countries around the world. ","Rin bar saves two buckets of water in every wash 23-03-2017  New Rin detergent bar with patented ‘smart-foam’ technology saves up to two buckets of water in every washing cycle  New Rin water saving detergent bar Hindustan Unilever Limited has relaunched Rin detergent bar which will help consumers save up to two buckets of water in every wash cycle. The product which has been launched across eight states in India uses ‘Smart Foam Technology’ which does not allow the foam to stick to clothes. This results in less usage of water while rinsing thus saving water.  Smart-foam technology Rinsing of clothes consumes 70% of the water in laundry as consumers keep rinsing until there is no visible foam on clothes. Rin’s “smart-foam” patented technology cuts the foam after cleaning during the rinse stage. This reduces the number of rinses, and helps the consumers to save water, time and effort. In addition to this, the new technology has improved the core properties of the brand – brightness and superior cleaning.  Aligned to Unilever Sustainable Living Plan Analysis by Unilever shows that around 38% of Unilever’s water footprint comes from the laundry process – a significant proportion of this is washing laundry by hand in the developing world. Unilever has set a target to halve the water associated with the consumer use of its products by 2020. Rin’s anti-foam bar is a step towards that mission. ","Sparkling bright clothes not only help form great impressions, but also provides confidence to realize ones ambitions. Rin understands this need and strives to deliver best in class whiteness and brightness through continuous innovation and product improvements.  Rin bar Rin was launched in India as a bar in 1969 with the iconic lightning mnemonic. Over the years, the brand has grown to become synonymous with providing ‘dazzling white clothes with one stroke.’  In 2016, Rin relaunched a water saving bar in key markets to address the rising water stress across India. Rin Bar now gives clothes the same dazzling brightness while saving half the water.  Rin detergent powder Rin detergent powder was launched in 1994. This was the first product extension from the iconic brand that stood for whiteness in laundry. We further introduced Rin Refresh with the fragrance of lemon & rose that penetrates every fibre to give the same brightness and freshness to boost confidence all day. In 2016, we also added Rin Antibac Powder to our portfolio which promises not just bright clothes, but also kills 99.9% germs.  Rin Ala Bleach being another ‘whiteness’ solution for numerous Indian households was a logical extension for the brand.  Rin Matic Rin also added Rin Matic, a specialist washing machine powder to its portfolio, based on the insight that ordinary powders do not deliver performance under machine wash conditions, thus addressing an unsatisfied consumer need.  Rin Career Ready Academy Across India, the middle class are determined to improve life for themselves and their families. They are progress seekers. They have the confidence and the determination, to move ahead, to progress and to Shine. Their appearance, their clothes, and their skills are critical in making them feel more confident. In 2015, Rin launched the Rin Career Ready Academy to prepare such talented youth for a brighter future. The Academy offers free courses in English Speaking, Office Dressing and Interview Training, which can be accessed either on www.rin.in or on voice.  Rin today The 'Rin' brand is trusted by millions of households across the country and continues to grow and gain the love and confidence of the Indian consumer.

This Children’s Day, Surf excel came up with a new brand campaign called ‘HaarKoHarao’ which encouraged people to look at failure as a learning experience.  As part of the campaign, the brand released a film which shows a social experiment called the ‘The Falling Test.’ The experiment was conducted with two groups of people, one being a group of adults and the other a group of children. Both the groups were asked to walk separately on a 20 feet long wooden log.  About 84% of the adults and 92% of the kids fell off the log. But, the difference showed up in the way both the groups responded to the fall. The adults were scared to try again while the kids demonstrated resilience and kept trying till they succeeded. Children even helped each other and eventually, all of them completed the task.  Now, the important question to ask ourselves is, Who taught our kids to fear failure? Be it studies or sports, we always emphasize the importance of winning and being successful. We hardly look at failure as a learning experience or even acknowledge what kids have learned along the way. And, in doing so, our fear of failure is unknowingly passed on to them.  Surf excel believes that kids are born fearless. They fall, pick themselves and try again. It’s time we changed our perspective about failure and talk about learning from it instead. After all, if we don't fail, how will we ever learn? ","Surf Excel launches new Liquid Detergent 24-05-2013  Two times better than detergent powder at stain removal.

The Dirt is Good Campaign The ‘Dirt is Good’ campaign began with the famous puddle war commercial, where a brother is shown taking revenge on a mud pool for spoiling his little sisters clothes. The ‘Dirt is Good’ communication continued with a series are stories of children getting dirty while doing something good … and hence dirt is good… and moms can leave it to Surf Excel to deal with the dirt.  This commercial helped the brand build high salience amongst the target audience and was followed up by equally interesting executions over the years. The consistency and distinctiveness of the campaign has led to building differentiation for Surf Excel that has resulted in strong growth for the brand.  Promoting values Surf’slatest campaign is a continuation of the same philosophy and brings the value of righteousness - the need to have the courage to stand up for what is right.

","Dishwashing detergents for dishwashers are manufactured and marketed variously as cartridges, gel, liquids, pacs, powder, and tablets.[6] Any dishwashing liquid may contain bleach, enzymes, or rinsing aids.[6] Some dishwashing detergents may be homemade, using ingredients such as borax, essential oil, eucalyptus oil and grated bar soap, among others.[7]  Dishwashing detergents can be formulated to work under different circumstances. In some cases suitably formulated they can be used with cold water or sea water, although they will not generally work as well as those intended for, and used with, hot water.  Common ingredients The main ingredient is water; the main active ingredients are detergents. Detergents are used, rather than soaps, because they don't react with any hardness in the water to form soap scum. There are other thickening and stabilizing agents.[8] Other ingredients may include surfactants, hydrotrope, salts, preservatives, fragrances, and dyes.[4]  Surfactants remove grease and stuck food particles.[4] They may also provide foam.[4]  Some dishwashing products contain phosphates in detergent. Phosphate makes dishes cleaner but can also cause harmful algal bloom as the wastewater goes back to the natural environment.[9] Because of this, it is banned as a component in many places.[9]  In 2010, the United States FDA raised health concerns over triclosan, an antibacterial substance used in some dish liquids.[10] Elsewhere, triclosan has been found to create problems at wastewater treatment plants, whereby it can sabotage some sludge-processing microbes and promote drug resistance in others.[11] The United States FDA has found that triclosan provides no health benefits over soap and water.[12] As of 2014, at least one state within the United States has banned triclosan in dishwashing liquids.[12]  Many dishwashing liquids contain perfume which can cause irritant or allergic contact dermatitis.[13]  Brands Euromonitor International research on dishwashing trends in eighty countries identified producers and brands with the largest 2013 retail value shares.[14] Five multinational companies (Procter and Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, Reckitt Benckiser, Unilever , Clean O Fast and HITRO PLUS), collectively held the greatest retail value shares in sixty-five of those countries.[14] Summaries below show percentages of retail value shares and leading brand names in each country, according to Euromonitor International's 2013 reports.

The summary of dishwashing in Kenya noted most consumers there use alternatives like laundry detergent powder or soap instead of dishwashing liquids, but listed Haco as the leading dishwashing liquid, from Haco Tiger Brands Ltd.[15]  Primary uses Dishwashing liquid is used primarily for removing food from used dishes and tableware.[4][6] Heavy soil (large food particles) is generally scraped from the dishes before using.[6] Detergent formula can vary based on use (hand or automatic).[4]  Hand dishwashing  Dishwashing liquid mixed with water on the left side of a sink Hand dishwashing is generally performed in the absence of a dishwashing machine, when large hard-to-clean items are present, or through preference.[4] Some dishwashing liquids can harm household silver, fine glassware, anything with gold leaf, disposable plastics, and any objects made of brass, bronze, cast iron, pewter, tin, or wood, especially when combined with hot water and the action of a dishwasher.[6] When dishwashing liquid is used on such objects it is intended that they be washed by hand.[6]  Hand dishwashing detergents utilize surfactants to play the primary role in cleaning.[4] The reduced surface tension of dishwashing water, and increasing solubility of modern surfactant mixtures, allows the water to run off the dishes in a dish rack very quickly. However, most people also rinse the dishes with pure water to make sure to get rid of any soap residue that could affect the taste of the food.[16]  Dishwashing liquid can be a skin irritant and cause hand eczema. Those with sensitive skin are advised amongst other things to persuade someone else to do the washing up.[17]  Automatic dishwashing Automatic dishwashing involves the use of a dishwashing machine or other apparatus.[4] It is generally chosen through convenience, sanitation, or personal preference.[4] The cleaning is less reliant on the detergent's surfactants but more reliant on machine's hot water as well as the detergent's builders, bleach, and enzymes.[4] Automatic dishwashing detergents' surfactants generally have less foam to avoid disrupting the machine.[ ","Brylcreem introduces a new beard & hair grooming range 12-06-2018  An Amazon.in exclusive  Beard and Hair Grooming Range Related brands Axe logo Axe Dove logo Dove Lifebuoy logo Lifebuoy Brylcreem is a brand associated with men of great character.

","Promptly reacting to its competitor's strategy to slash price of shampoos to gain market share, FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has also taken to price cuts and has started aggressive promotions in its shampoo brands.  Two weeks ago, multinational consumer products maker Procter & Gamble had slashed prices of its shampoo brands Head and Shoulders and Pantene by 15-32 per cent.  According to sources, HUL has also taken a similar price cut in brands such as Clinic Plus and Dove. It is also running massive promotions in the 100 ml and 200 ml packs. However, the Indian arm of Anglo-Dutch company Unilever has left it’s premium brand Tresseme untouched.  HUL did not respond to a query from BusinessLine. However, this is the first time that HUL has promptly reacted to a competitors’ strategy in a price war.  Nitin Mathur, analyst at Societe Generale said that though the price cut can be due to a tug of war between the two FMCG majors over market share, it could be also due to the reason that companies were passing on the benefits of easing commodity prices to its consumers.  According to Mathur, P&G, which is struggling in the Indian market, has taken a mixed pricing strategy globally. While it has cut prices in the India, it has increased the same in markets such as Russia and Brazil.  He also added that such strategies (price cuts) don't last long. For the US-based company, HUL is the biggest competitor in several segments such as shampoos, hair oil, soaps and detergents and toothpaste.

Celebrate the energy and spontaneity that is brand Liril  Liril is infused with the zing of Lime for that unmistakable tingling freshness.  Key facts One of the oldest soap brands in India A brand that has been consistent in bringing alive freshness A brand that has managed to create breakthrough advertising over the years ","Liril Fresh is back 03-11-2015  Liril-Fresh-is-Back-400-225 Related brands Axe logo Axe Dove logo Dove Lifebuoy logo Lifebuoy Related Links Watch the new TVC The secret to creating new advertising on long existing brands is to stay true to the core elements of what the brand is made of. What people remember even after many years is the original promise – the character, visual appeal, colour and sound. Preferences and formats might change, but the core attributes of any brand stay in the minds of consumers. And relaunching such brands is essentially about going back to its roots.  Even after all these years, when we say Liril, people from all walks of life fondly recall the waterfall, the girl, her spontaneity and energy. They hum the jingle then and there. And these are the roots of Liril. They don’t change. And what we’re doing is paying homage to the Liril that we all know, bringing alive the very same elements that have been part of our popular culture through time. The campaign is a modern rendition of the original ad and is designed to remind and get Liril into the hearts and homes of the consumer.  The brand launched a new TVC with the unforgettable jingle. Led by TV and print, the jingle teased people’s memories, setting them up for what was to come. The full campaign followed with the memorable rendition of the waterfall ad across mediums, from television, to radio and digital avatars.  The fresh new pack is in market, with the lemony freshness of the brand prominent on shelves. ","If there is one thing that has been consistent with commercials for Hindustan Lever's (HUL's) Liril soap, it has been its jingle. Think Liril and the next thing that comes rushing to mind is its trademark 'La, lalala, la, la, la'. This tune is closely followed by the visual of a girl frolicking under a waterfall.  The Liril Girl, conceived in 1974 by ad agency Lintas (now Lowe Lintas & Partners), and discontinued in 2009, is quite simply an audio-visual treat. A girl having fun under a waterfall with a Liril soap for company hardly changed during the campaign's 35-year run. In commercial after commercial, the Liril Girl - from the original model Karen Lunel to actors Pooja Batra, Preity Zinta and Deepika Padukone - could be seen playing in the water, diving, jumping and swimming under the waterfall. The voice-over simply amplifies the message of freshness, the attribute of the soap.  In many respects, the Liril Girl set the tone for ads that worked at a subliminal level that became common in the 1970s, different from the chatter of ads that blatantly advertised product benefits. These ads appealed to the consumers' latent desires. At no given point, however, were they vulgar. In the Liril Girl's case, she was vivacious with bright eyes and an infectious smile. She could swim, dance and have fun with no fear of the camera or the world at large.  –– ADVERTISEMENT ––  Adman Alyque Padamsee, who was the co-creator along with Neena Merchant, another Lintas hand, says, The beauty of the Liril Girl was that she appealed to the senses. People enjoyed seeing her, which is why she stood out.  Yet, the Liril Girl would not have come into being had HUL's (then called Hindustan Lever) original plan worked. The maker of brands such as Lifebuoy and Lux, wanted a soap that signified freshness. The solution the company's marketing team first came up with was one that stood for the freshness of the mountain breeze - represented by a blue soap. It, however, flopped in initial product trials, prompting the team to work with Lintas in changing it to a lime-based soap that was green.  But the bigger challenge was marketing a lime soap, which was the first of its kind in India. Padamsee says he did something that was never done before. He commissioned a consumer survey to find out what women really wanted out of a freshness soap. The survey led him to an interesting insight: The Indian housewife, the target audience, had time to herself only during her 10 to 15-minute daily bath, day-dreaming about how her favourite Bollywood actor.  In other words, Padamsee explains, She wanted to escape. And her shower in the bathroom was symbolic of this, where she suspended her struggles as a housewife for some time and simply enjoyed her bath. To make it real, Padamsee, who was creative director at Lintas, came up with a metaphor for the bathroom shower - a waterfall.  The team would eventually shoot in the waterfalls in Khandala in Maharashtra for some shots, and in Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu, for others. As a result, the Pambar Falls in Kodaikanal bills itself as the Liril Falls to this day to attract tourists.  But the bigger task was carrying out his brief - girl bathing under a waterfall. He says, We screened some 100 girls before finding Karen. Women could identify with her and many in our survey post-release said that Karen could be their daughter. In other words, our objective was not to make her look sensuous, but project her as a girl who was simply having fun. This is why I think she did so well and people, both young and old, male and female, liked her.   Lunel remained the face of Liril from 1974 to 1985 - the longest for any Liril Girl. She was replaced by a number of models through the 1980s, the 1990s and the early part of the twenty-first century. As Padmasee says, The Liril Girl became a gateway for young women to get into Bollywood. While I was happy about this, I am not sure whether the choice of girls were the best. Barring a few such as Preity (Zinta), Tara (Sharma) or Deepika (Padukone), most of them were largely forgettable.  But the big break from the past came in 2005, when HUL relaunched Liril as Liril 2000, positioning the freshness soap as a family soap. It did this to arrest falling market share since freshness was no longer the unique attribute for Liril. Godrej Consumer's Cinthol, too, had positioned itself on freshness as it did a host of other brands. Padamsee says Liril, as the first lime soap, notched up a share of 25 per cent by the end of the first year of its launch (1975), becoming the top-selling brand for HUL. By 2005, however, it slid to low single digits, according to industry sources, prompting the re-positioning. As R Balakrishnan, chairman & chief creative officer, Lowe Lintas & Partners, says, There were many other soaps that had freshness as an attribute. Plus, the company's priorities were changing.  By 2009, the Liril Girl bid adieu and with it a chapter in Indian advertising came to an end. The Liril Girl began losing steam somewhere in the nineties. I don't think there was enough thought put to who was being cast. The company was experimenting with variants of Liril, which I think distracted it a bit, says Padamsee. ","Rexona was launched in the year 1947 as a natural skin care soap that gives silky, glowing skin. Rexona’s irresistibly silky soft skin and lingering aromatic fragrance proposition has been an ally to the Indian women to keep those compliments flowing in from their loved ones.  The Indian woman uses products that deliver beauty through skin care but needs the assurance of natural ingredients. She believes that her natural look is her best beauty accessory. She takes the effort to look good and wants to keep the romance alive in her life. This is where Rexona plays a key role b making women look and feel beautiful through the use of natural ingredients.  Rexona comes with the natural goodness of Coconut and Olive oils, which moisturize the skin and leave it silky smooth. Coconut oil has been an inherent ingredient in the soap for more than two decades and has become synonymous with Rexona brand. Olive oil was introduced in the soap in 2009. ","Intelligent deodorant Our Rexona deodorant uses body-responsive micro-capsule technology that kicks in when it’s needed most, giving people the confidence to face the day's more stressful situations.  The challenge Woman applying deoderant after showering Instances of stress – whether expected or unforeseen – can make people sweat more than usual. However, at times like these most deodorants can’t cope. Our challenge was to develop a product that offered extra protection at such moments, delivering additional freshness and giving consumers the confidence that comes from knowing they look in control.  Understanding sweat The key to solving the issue lay in understanding sweat. Our studies showed that humans produce two quite different types: physical sweat that the body makes when it’s hot, and sweat that breaks out in moments of stress, anxiety or high emotion. Unlike physical sweating, emotional sweating occurs predominantly on the hands and armpits. This type can produce up to five times more sweat than the physical kind and can smell more unpleasant. Physical sweat takes five to ten minutes to occur; emotional sweat can be instantaneous.  Responsive technology Since deodorants deal primarily with physical sweat, we set about developing a technology that could also cope with emotional sweat. In partnership with key suppliers, our scientists developed a new anti-perspirant – Rexona Activreserve – whose special micro-capsules of odour protection are activated when the body responds to stressful situations.  These capsules sit on the skin’s surface. When pressure or stress cause a sudden, uncontrollable burst of sweat in the underarms, the sweat dissolves the capsules giving extra odour protection when it’s most needed. So whether an individual is sweating a lot or a little, the technology will always release the right amount of protection.  Putting it to the test Using assessors who are trained to sniff body odour and rate its intensity and character, we demonstrated that Rexona Activreserve continues to reduce odour up to 24 hours after it’s applied, even with multiple stressful moments during the day. ","Unilever’s INR 55 billion ($1.36 billion) brand – Rexona, internationally spans across 90 markets worldwide commanding 14.5% share of the global deodorant market. In India, as one of the pioneer brands of Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), Rexona was worth INR 1.78 billion in 2006. With an annual growth rate of 28%, Rexona continued to compete as one of the core brands in HUL’s brand portfolio. Launched as a soap brand, Rexona’s journey through Indian fast moving consumer goods market has been a dramatic one. At the end of 2006, the brand managed to emerge as a mass deodorant brand, albeit with some hiccups. The case discusses the challenges faced by the popular brand, despite creating a market which was virtually non-existent in India. The case also discusses the Indian consumers’ perception towards body odour and the challenges for Rexona in changing the consumer outlook towards deodorants. The case inculcates various dimensions of brand positioning and the challenges of repositioning a deodorant brand.  Pedagogical Objective:  To study the trends in the homecare and personal care market in India To understand the rationale behind the repositioning of Rexona deodorant To discuss the challenges for Rexona in the process of brand repositioning.

The simple act of handwashing with soap can avert many of these deaths. Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost-effective ways to save a child’s life.  At a recent event held in Mumbai, our health soap brand Lifebuoy in partnership with the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) announced an initiative to empower young girls. Through this partnership girl guides and scouts will become handwashing heroes and would teach the lifesaving habit of handwashing with soap within their local communities.  Each handwashing hero is trained on the importance of using soap while washing hands before eating and after using the toilet. They are also equipped with the necessary skills to share these learnings with other people they know. In this way, the practice of using soap at critical occasions is encouraged to spread across communities protecting people from illnesses and infections. Over 1,200 girl guides and scouts have been trained so far under this partnership.  During the event, Sanjiv Mehta, CEO and Managing Director, HUL along with Samir Singh, Executive Vice President, Global Skin Cleansing, Unilever and Lifebuoy’s Help A Child Reach 5 handwashing ambassador, Kajol Devgn came together to recognise and award these handwashing heroes for being the real agents of behaviour change. It is estimated that these handwashing heroes will positively impact about 4 million people.  Sanjiv Mehta said, “We believe that companies like HUL have a key role in helping the country achieve ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’. More than 90% of households in India use HUL products. This gives us an opportunity and a responsibility to make a meaningful difference. We are convinced that we can achieve this, leveraging our expertise in behaviour change programmes in the areas of handwashing and sanitation and our experience in developing and delivering innovative partnership models.”  Samir Singh said, “I feel proud to see Lifebuoy’s handwashing movement Help A Child Reach 5 go to the next level through this partnership with WAGGGS. One of our biggest learnings has been that children have in them the abilities to drive behaviour change. Through this partnership, Lifebuoy is unleashing the potential of young girls, who shall be empowered to transform the health of entire communities.  We started in a small village called Thesgora in Madhya Pradesh in 2013 with the highest rates of diarrhoea and were able to showcase remarkable results owing to a focussed handwashing intervention. We hope that this partnership with WAGGGS will help us push the envelope further with communities and families adapting healthy handwashing habits through these incredible handwashing heroes.”  Ana Maria Mideros, WAGGGS’ World Board Chair, said “At the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, we know that every girl has the power and potential to learn, lead and make a positive change in her community and the wider world. We are hugely proud that our partnership with Lifebuoy is helping young people in India to take action and promote handwashing with soap - both at home and in their wider communities. Working with Lifebuoy, Girl Guides and Scouts are driving change, improving hygiene and changing lives.”  Lifebuoy’s Help A Child Reach 5 Handwashing Ambassador Kajol Devgn said, “As a mother and a woman I am really excited about this partnership with WAGGGS. What inspired me the most was how these girl heroes are determined and passionate about making a difference in the lives of others by educating people on basic hygiene practices such as handwashing. We need many more such young heroes to help address some easily preventable health and hygiene issues.”  About Hindustan Unilever: Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) is India's largest Fast Moving Consumer Goods company with its products touching the lives of nine out of ten households in India.

About Lifebuoy As the world’s leading health soap, Lifebuoy aims to make a difference by creating accessible hygiene products (soap) and promoting healthy hygiene habits.

","Lifebuoy partners Gavi to save children's lives 18-01-2017  Gavi and Unilever's Lifebuoy join forces to tackle preventable diseases and save children's lives  Ground-breaking partnership will raise awareness of the power of immunisation and of handwashing with soap to accelerate child survival efforts in India.  Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and Lifebuoy, Unilever’s leading health soap brand are today launching an innovative partnership to protect children under five from childhood illnesses and premature death. By promoting handwashing with soap and immunisation together - two of the most cost effective child survival interventions - the partnership aims to improve and save many young lives in India.  Announced at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2017 in Davos, Switzerland, the partnership will be supported by the Government of Netherlands through Gavi’s Matching Fund mechanism and by the Government of India, where the initial project to implement a joint approach to promote healthier behaviours will take place.  Pneumonia and diarrhoea are two leading causes of child deaths worldwide. India has the highest number of pneumonia and diarrhoea deaths among children in the world with nearly 300,000 children dying from these illnesses. Such preventable diseases are also often attributed to lack of handwashing with soap at critical occasions. While progress is being made with the introduction of rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines as well as hygiene programmes, more needs to be done to accelerate the fight against these diseases.  “Diarrhoea and pneumonia are two of the most devastating preventable illnesses which claim the lives of millions of children worldwide”, said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi. “Integrated interventions that begin at birth, including clean water and vaccines, can protect against these diseases. Therefore I welcome the Gavi and Lifebuoy partnership, which is a great example of public and private sectors working together to help prevent millions of unnecessary deaths and save lives of the most vulnerable children”, he added.  The three-year partnership will leverage Unilever’s expertise in behaviour change, marketing capability, and financial support along with Gavi’s supply, health systems strengthening investments and Alliance networks to deliver behaviour change interventions and promote the benefits of vaccination, handwashing with soap and good hygiene to key target audiences in India. This will have a positive impact on multiple Sustainable Development Goals including good health and well-being (Goal 3), clean water and sanitation (Goal 6) and it will help revitalise global partnerships for sustainable development (Goal 17).  Samir Singh, Global Executive Vice President, Skin Cleansing, Unilever, said, “Lifebuoy has reached over 65 million people through handwashing behaviour change programmes in India. We are very happy to collaborate with GAVI and through this association hope to create a more holistic approach to fighting preventable diseases among children. Through our various awareness generation and education programmes as well as through our valued partners we hope to continue to teach school children, new mothers, and the community at large, the practice of handwashing with soap at key occasions and make it a habit, helping more children reach their fifth birthday.”  Kajol Devgan, Help A Child Reach 5 Handwashing Ambassador, said, “As a mother and an actor, I am proud to be associated with a campaign that stresses on the importance of handwashing to prevent needless child deaths. I have advocated the importance of handwashing on many international as well as local platforms. While advocacy is important, it is also equally important to back that up with targeted programmes especially at the grass roots level. Lifebuoy’s Help A Child Reach 5 has been able to do this really well and is continuing to do so by accelerating its efforts every year.  Lifebuoy runs one of the world’s largest hygiene promotion programmes which aims to change the handwashing behaviours of a billion people by 2020. The partnership will be rooted in existing interventions that leverage Lifebuoy’s approach to behaviour change and contribute to further making handwashing with soap at key occasions an ingrained habit whilst accelerating vaccine uptake. Unilever and Gavi will measure results of the behaviour change programme with an aim to further scale up the integrated approach.  Unilever’s financial contribution will be matched by the Government of Netherlands, as part of the Gavi Matching Fund mechanism, which will double the resources put toward the partnership, in turn driving greater impact in the lives of children and their families.

In 2008 Pepsodent collaborated with the Indian Dental Association (IDA) and the World Dental Association (FDI) to help educate school children on the importance of regular brushing.

Pepsodent has a range of toothpastes and toothbrushes that could take care of specific oral care needs.

Key facts Endorsed by FDI ( the largest dental association globally) Among the most trusted brands in India (Brand Equity, Economic Times, India) Also sold as Mentadent, Zhonghua, PS and Signal in other countries ","Pepsodent campaign to promote oral hygiene 30-09-2014  Pepsodent partnered with over 48 bhel vendors across Mumbai to spread the message of oral hygiene through paintings created by children.  Bhel being a popular snack in India, especially in Mumbai, allowed Pepsodent to successfully reach out to over 1 lakh consumers through this activity. The digitized image of the oral care message derived from the paintings was printed on fresh biodegradable paper in non-toxic colour and used to serve bhel to consumers. As consumers would finish eating the bhel, they would realize that there was a message on the paper reminding them on the importance of brushing their teeth at night through the creative paintings that these children had made.  This campaign was conducted as a culmination of the oral health education programmes in schools for a year. Pepsodent reached out to 2.5 lakh children in 39 cities across India. Children made all kinds of paintings - from how not brushing properly can result in germs that cause cavities, to how these bacteria settle on the teeth’s surface to form plaque, which if not brushed away at regular intervals can cause oral problems.  Pepsodent has an extensive school contact programme that educates children between the ages of 6 and 14 about the importance of brushing twice a day. However, the fact is that most adults also don’t brush twice a day in India. Pepsodent decided to team up with children to spread this message to adults in a very creative manner and at a time when the message would be most relevant for them. The campaing was based on the consumer insight that children play a key role in making adults adopt the right habits.

However, India is the only country where the company has decided to launch bathing bars keeping in view the growing demand. Major players in the premium bathing bar category are Godrej’s Cinthol, Raymond’s Park Avenue and ITC’s Fiama di Wills, that also has shower gels. HUL’s Denim brand of body sprays also has been extended into bathing bars earlier.  In a bid to grow Axe master brand, it was important that Axe be present in all emerging youth-centric future formats such as shower gels and soaps. It is logical for the company to tap the growing men’s grooming opportunity in the body wash segment in India, said Mr Sudhir Sitapati, Category Head of Personal Wash.  “FY 11-12 was a very good year for the personal wash category not only for us but also for other industry players. The body wash category is 100 per cent penetrated in India but is a very small market and there is a huge opportunity for all. We are the market leaders in the body wash segment,” Mr Sitapati said.  According to Neilsen, the body wash segment in India is a mere Rs 44 crore and is growing at 46 per cent. HUL is the biggest player in this segment with a 36 per cent share with brands such as Lux, Dove, and Pears and now Axe. “The extended categories will enhance the growth of the brand’s architecture as all categories have the same fragrance of bold and urban sex appeal like the mother brand Axe,” said Mr Subhobroto Chakraborty, Business Head, Genesis.  He further added that brand extensions have always been the strategy of HUL to have one brand at different price points and across categories to encircle the consumer.  “Such organic growth extensions will not dilute the mother brand’s core promise and work as an endorser,” he said. ","HUL launches Axe Soap Bar for Men 30-07-2012  Hindustan Unilever has launched Axe Soap Bar for men in India.

","Battling skin damage 23-08-2012  In the fight against skin woes, keeping your skin well-moisturised is half the battle won.  woman using facial cleanser Related brands Axe logo Axe Dove logo Dove Lifebuoy logo Lifebuoy Related Stories New Dove Handwash launched New Dove Nourishing Handwash launched Break the Rules of Beauty Dove inspires India to “Break the Rules of Beauty” Range of  Dove Products Damage free hair with Dove Convenient as it may seem, a casual approach to dealing with skin problems is never the best way to go. Using ordinary soaps to wash your face or not hydrating your skin before you head outdoors are some of the most common mistakes that we make, which result in dull, lifeless skin. We chat with our expert on the benefits that moisturising can have and how it can transform dull skin into healthy and glowing skin.  What does 'moisturising' mean? It may be the last step of the skincare routine, but moisturising is also the most essential. After thoroughly cleansing and toning the skin, reaching out for that bottle of moisturiser is a must for all. Well-moisturised skin looks healthy and smooth. A moisturiser acts like a protective agent that prevents harmful environmental pollution from damaging the skin. It battles and repairs the wear-and-tear that the skin goes throughout during the day.  Moisturising is for all Unlike the popular belief, a moisturiser can be of help for oily skin type too. Since women with an oily T-zone tend to wash their face more often, a light moisturiser can bring in the moisture without adding to the grease. Moisturising on a daily basis helps in avoiding water loss from the skin and in restoring its natural texture and balance.  What makes my skin dry? Using harsh soaps and face washes to wash your face, is one of the most common causes of skin damage. Most of these products are infused with soapy-elements that are not suitable for facial skin. They lather well, but do little cleansing. In the long run, these sap the natural oils that the skin produces and dries out the skin.  Inadequate quantity of water can also lead to dry skin. The water we drink does not only quench our thirst, but also hydrates the skin from within. To ensure you get your fill, drink at least eight glasses of water per day so that the body remains hydrated. Lastly, insufficient moisturising can also be a reason for dreary skin. Choose a moisturiser specifically meant for your skin type, because a wrong product could lead to more serious skin problems.  What are the types of moisturisers? There are generally two types of moisturisers that one can choose from - oil-based and water-based. The rule of picking them varies depending on your skin type. An oil-based moisturiser, as the name would suggest, contains more oil. It is best suited for a dry and damaged skin type, since it helps in restoring the skin’s water and oil balance.  If you have an oily or combination skin, an oil-based moisturiser is best avoided. Instead, pick something that is water-based - it is light-weight and easy on the skin. Water-based moisturisers are absorbed quickly and don’t leave any traces of grease on the skin.  You could also look out for skincare products that come enriched with ingredients such as cream, milk, peaches, honey, aloe vera, since they have hydrating properties. Another option is to opt for soaps that come with an in-built moisturising system as it helps battle daily dryness.  What is the best way to moisturise my skin? Here are some tips on how to apply moisturiser:  Moisturiser should be applied to damp skin immediately after cleansing. This helps in balancing the lost natural oils from the body. Moisturise each time you cleanse and tone. Don't apply too much moisturiser. Stick to what the brand recommends. Too much can lead to clogged pores and blackheads. Always apply your moisturiser by upward hand movements. It lasts longer that way. Concentrate on areas that need more moisture. Under the eyes, corners of the mouth, lips and cheeks are such areas. For a moisturiser to really work, exfoliate your skin regularly. This helps get rid of the dead skin cell build-up.

After all, no one likes to be stuck with the same look for too long. So, a comb in your pocket and hair clips at hand, you straighten, you colour, you curl, you styleâ€¦ all for that perfectly turned out look. Do you find that putting your hair through so much stress makes it dry, difficult to style and unmanageable? If your answer is yes, then you've got a case of damaged hair!  What causes hair damage? There are a number of factors that lead to hair damage - ranging from your sleeping habits to your beauty regime. One of the most common of these is chemical treatments such as hair colouring, bleaching, dyeing, perming and straightening, which may leave it looking good, but not necessarily in the best shape. Another cause is the frequent use of dryers and other hair styling equipment, as they make your hair frizzy, dry and brittle.  Finally, even if you manage to avoid all the above mentioned factors, you may still be causing damage to your hair without even realising it! A number of lifestyle related factors such as stress and a poor diet are also known to contribute to weak and damaged hair.  Repair your hair! You can fight hair damage and revitalise your hair by using the right products and following a few simple steps in your hair care regime. Always wash your hair with lukewarm or cold water, as hot water dissolves your natural scalp oil which protects the shine of your hair. One of the main reasons of hair damage is dryness. Without sufficient moisture, your hair becomes brittle and damaged. Unfortunately, most treatments only repair damaged hair on the cuticle level, leaving the innermost layers in the same condition.  For true repair, the treatment must do much more than just moisturise the surface - it should penetrate the core of each hair strand and replenish it inside out. Dove Intense Damage Repair Therapy, the latest hair care range from Dove, does just that!  Each product in the Dove Intense Damage Repair Therapy range contains advanced Fibre Actives that reconstruct and repair hair from within, and reduces hair damage by up to 99%* from the first wash itself! The Micro Moisture Serum in the products ensures softer, smoother and stronger hair that you'll love to flaunt!  A harsh, non-conditioning shampoo is likely to harm your hair in the long run. With Dove Intense Repair Shampoo, you can bid goodbye to split ends and say hello to smoother strands, as the Fibre Actives and Micro Moisture Serum repair damage from within your hair. Your hair stays strong, sleek and resilient to damage. Besides shampoo, proper conditioning is essential for the hair, especially if it is dry, brittle and damaged. A good conditioner can moisturize your hair from root to tip, not leaving it dull/unmanageable. And for this, the Dove Intense Repair Conditioner is your perfect pick!  Did you know that the Sun's UV rays are harmful to your hair? Excessive exposure to the Sun can make your hair dry. But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy a day out in the Sun. Simply use theDove Intense Repair Leave-on Cream before stepping out and you are good to go! It provides additional conditioning that allows your hair to retain its moisture. It also repairs severely damaged hair and protects it throughout the day without making it limp.  For hair that is damaged due to excessive styling, try using a moisturising agent like a hair mask. Apply a generous amount of Dove Intense Repair Mask on your hair, concentrating from the middle of the strands to the ends. Leave it on for 3-5 minutes before you rinse it off and relax while it does all the work! While shielding your hair from dryness and protecting your strands from damage, it also restores up to one week of protein loss to your hair, which leaves it soft, smooth and oh-so-touchable!  If your hair is severely damaged and is in desperate need for some emergency pampering, treat it with the Dove Intense Repair Overnight Treatment. It repairs your damaged hair while you are asleep, making up for protein loss to give you strong hair. Yes, sleep is often the solution to all problems! Just apply 2-4 drops to your strands, concentrating from the middle to the ends, and either wash your hair, or style as you wish, in the morning.  Don't let hair damage give you sleepless nights.

So this winter, treat yourself with Dove's range of body lotions. Choose a product that suits your skin and apply it before bed or immediately after a bath.  Tip: Not sure which of these three moisturisers will suit your needs best? Try applying a little lotion on your elbow (or a patch of dry skin) and see if it absorbs well. Remember, your moisturising needs may change according to the season. While summer months may warrant the Go Fresh Nourishment, the drier months of the winter season may deserve a dose of Indulgent Nourishment.

Continuing the trend, the country’s largest consumer goods company Hindustan Unilever (HUL) on Thursday announced that it was bringing its skincare brand Citra to India.  In a post-results interaction with analysts on Wednesday, the management said it was looking to ramp up its specialist brands in the herbal space and Citra would join Indulekha, the specialist haircare Ayurvedic brand from the company.

","With new CLEAR, Dandruff Wont Come Back!*  Clear is Unilever’s leading anti dandruff shampoo brand. Since it’s first launch in 1972, in Asia the Clear formulation has continuously evolved with intensive research and clinical trials conducted by scientists at the Clear Paris Institute. With a constant focus on leading edge technology, Clear is pegged as the world’s leading scalp care shampoo.  Clinical research shows that dandruff and other scalp problems like dryness originate deep under the scalp. Washing away visible flakes on the surface does little to treat the root cause, which is a weak and damaged scalp barrier. Thus, dandruff keeps coming back.  Experts at Clear understand that scalp is skin. Therefore CLEAR has partnered with the world’s leading dermatologists from the International Academy of Dermatology (IACD) to bring the scalp nutrient technology –NEW CLEAR with Nutrium 10 to its consumers.  Nutrium 10 is customized for men as – Pro Nutrium 10, and for women as – Nutrium 10. Combining the benefits of pro-vitamins, minerals and sunflower oils, Nutrium 10 treats dandruff at the root: nourishes the scalp to eliminate flakes, soothes dryness and repairs the scalp barrier to strengthen its natural resistance.  New CLEAR Anti-Dandruff Shampoo’s Nutrium 10 has been identified by IACD as the scalp care technology that will lead the paradigm shift in scalp care management. It took years in the making and is a part of CLEAR’s mission to deliver the most effective anti dandruff shampoo for healthy scalp and hair. This technology will contribute not only to better scalp health, but also improve dandruff sufferers’ quality oflife.  Key Facts Clear is the only brand that offers a specially formulated Anti dandruff shampoo for men Clear is the world’s No. 1 Male AD shampoo Today, Clear is present in almost 40 markets like Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Arabia, Russia, Turkey, China amongst others More than 1 billion people have tried CLEAR Clear also has Anti Dandruff Hair Oil that fights dandruff and nourishes your scalp making your hair stronger ","Clean, safe & affordable water It’s a shocking statistic that some two billion people on the planet do not have access to clean water.  A global problem Woman collecting water from a Sunlight water centre In the developing world, water-borne diseases such as jaundice, typhoid and cholera are widespread. In fact, child mortality is directly related to diarrhoea which, in India alone, accounts for around 400,000 deaths every year.  So Unilever set about working with technology partners, government bodies, and scientific and public health institutions to develop an effective and affordable answer.  An accessible solution Launched in India in 2005, PureIt products are the only in-home purifiers to provide water that’s ‘as safe as boiled’ without the need for cooking gas, electricity or a pressurised supply. One unit costs €32 to buy and around half a euro cent per litre to run, making it much more affordable than alternatives.  During 2008, the product was rolled out to 23 states in India, and reached all 28 by early 2009. It is now bringing safe drinking water to more than five million people in a million households.  Breakthrough technology PureIt is a feat of engineering innovation developed through the combined efforts of over a hundred qualified scientists at Unilever research labs in India and the UK.  In a four-stage process, microfibre mesh first removes visible dirt. The water then flows through a compact carbon trap which removes harmful parasites and pesticide impurities. The Germkill™ processor uses sustained release chlorine technology to target and kill viruses and bacteria. Finally a polisher removes further impurities and residual chlorine to give great tasting water that’s odourless and visibly clear.  The unique battery life indicator alerts consumers when to replace the battery kit and an auto switch-off feature provides an additional assurance of safety by stopping the flow of water when the indicator turns red.  Brought to life through partnership Whilst developing the technology was a difficult but realistic challenge for Unilever scientists, creating the actual product needed experience and expertise beyond our capabilities. We sought a partner who could bring what we couldn’t – knowledge of aesthetics in the design and manufacture of the units.  This was a really successful partnership, not least because the nature of the collaboration made it hugely motivating for all to seek solutions to various issues encountered along the way.  Proof of performance PureIt quickly proved its credentials within the scientific, medical and public health community, and convinced doctors of its efficacy. Its performance has been verified and endorsed by leading institutions such as the Sundaram Medical Foundation, the Indian Public Health Association and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It also meets the criteria of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the toughest regulatory body in the US.  What’s more, the product has received numerous awards including the 2008 UK Trade and Investment India Business Award for innovation, the UNESCO Water Digest Water Award 2008/09 for the best domestic non-electrical purifier, and the 2008 Golden Peacock Product/Service Innovation Award.

","Two of India’s biggest consumer goods companies are sparring again, this time over a men’s fairness cream advertisement.  Emami, based in Kolkata, has got a local court to pass a temporary order restraining rival Hindustan Unilever (HUL) from airing a campaign that shows its brand, Fair and Handsome, in a poor light. With a revenue of Rs2,540 crore in the financial year 2018, Emami sells a range of popular personal care brands such as Zandu balm, Navratna oil, and BoroPlus cream across India.  The ad for HUL’s Fair & Lovely Men’s Fairness Cream, which began airing recently, has Bollywood star Siddharth Malhotra urging consumers to “choose wisely” between its “original” and the “other”—Fair and Handsome—a tube of which is also placed in the video.   A screen grab from the ad spot aired by Hindustan Unilever. Following Emami’s plea earlier this week, a court in Serampore, near Kolkata, passed an order on June 19 restraining HUL from circulating and displaying the commercial till July 06. HUL has also been barred from publishing the advertisement in print or any other medium, Emami said in a statement on June 20.  In an email, an Emami spokesperson said that the recent commercial has caused “direct disparagement to Emami’s Fair and Handsome Fairness Cream for Men, by showing and naming the Fair and Handsome pack directly in communication.”  Emami also sent legal notices to seven television networks—Star India, Sun TV Network, Sony Pictures, Viacom 18, Zee Entertainment, 9 X Media, and B4U Television Network—barring them from airing the commercial.  The company’s prompt actions come at a time when India’s market for whitening products—estimated at Rs2,000 crore—is becoming fiercely competitive. For the longest time firms wooed only women. But thanks to a boom in the male grooming products available now, men are also queuing up. In fact, urban Indian men believe that fair skin can improve their professional prospects, a 2015 report by research agency Nielsen showed.  That is why companies including L’Oréal, HUL, Emami, and Nivea have invested heavily in skin-brightening products for men.  Emami’s Fair and Handsome was among the first male-specific whitening products, launched back in 2005 and helped build the category in the country. The brand has an over 60% market share in the segment, according to Nielsen.  HUL’s Fair & Lovely has been around for decades, though a product for men was only introduced in 2007.  In any case, this isn’t the first time the two brands are fighting it out over an advertisement.  In 2017, HUL moved the Advertising Standard Council of India (ASCI), an ad industry watchdog, over a Fair and Handsome commercial. Mumbai-based HUL challenged the veracity of several claims made in Emami’s ad. The complaint was, however, rejected by the ASCI.  HUL did not respond to e-mail queries sent by Quartz. ","Hindustan Unilever has filed a caveat petition in the Mumbai High Court against EmamiNSE -1.73 %, anticipating the rival to approach the court against an HULNSE -0.43 % ad that takes a potshot at Emami’s Fair and Handsome fairness cream for men. Emami said it is evaluating the latest television commercial for HUL’s Men’s Fair and Lovely brand and “will take all necessary action as deemed fit”. Industry executives said HUL recently launched the new campaign, which names the rival’s brand ..

","HUL to license Lakme and Lever Ayush brands to Lakme Lever Private Limited 06-01-2009  HUL to license 'Lakme' and 'Lever Ayush', brands to its subsidiary, Lakme Lever Private Limited, for the Beauty and Wellness services business.  Growing disposable income and changing lifestyles in urban India has led to greater awareness about personal grooming, health and wellness. The emerging trends, augur well, for Beauty and Wellness services sector, presenting a large and exciting opportunity. HUL currently operates in the Beauty and Wellness services segment, through a network of largely franchised Lakme Beauty Salons and Ayush Therapy Centers. However, as per current business model, these contribute to an insignificant proportion of the Company’s, turnover and profits.  The key learnings to achieve success are: a) single minded focus in creating and nurturing a ‘service’ mindset b) excellence in execution by specialized and dedicated teams, passionate about beauty and wellness services and c) a different business model, appropriate for a ‘services’ business.  The HUL Board of Directors took note of these facts and the learnings of the Company. The Board approved the licensing of the Lakme and Lever Ayush brands to the separate subsidiary company, Lakme Lever Private Limited, who will evaluate options towards developing a uniquely different, new business model for this opportunity, with singularity of purpose and dedicated focus. Consequently, HUL will not be directly engaged in the services business of Lakme salons and Ayush Therapy Centres.

      <h3>Our Journey</h3>
      <p>HUL History
In the summer of 1888, visitors to the Kolkata harbour noticed crates full of Sunlight soap bars, embossed with the words "Made in England by Lever Brothers". With it, began an era of marketing branded Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG).
</p>
<p>
Soon after followed Lifebuoy in 1895 and other famous brands like Pears, Lux and Vim. Vanaspati was launched in 1918 and the famous Dalda brand came to the market in 1937. 
In 1931, Unilever set up its first Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Vanaspati Manufacturing Company, followed by Lever Brothers India Limited (1933) and United Traders Limited (1935). These three companies merged to form HUL in November 1956; HUL offered 10% of its equity to the Indian public, being the first among the foreign subsidiaries to do so. Unilever now holds 67.25% equity in the company. The rest of the shareholding is distributed among about three lakh individual shareholders and financial institutions.
</p>
<p>
The erstwhile Brooke Bond's presence in India dates back to 1900. By 1903, the company had launched Red Label tea in the country. In 1912, Brooke Bond & Co. India Limited was formed. Brooke Bond joined the Unilever fold in 1984 through an international acquisition. The erstwhile Lipton's links with India were forged in 1898. Unilever acquired Lipton in 1972, and in 1977 Lipton Tea (India) Limited was incorporated.
</p>
<p>

Pond's (India) Limited had been present in India since 1947. It joined the Unilever fold through an international acquisition of Chesebrough Pond's USA in 1986. 
</p>

<p>
In 2007, the Company name was formally changed to Hindustan Unilever Limited after receiving the approval of share holders during the 74th AGM on 18 May 2007. Brooke Bond and Surf Excel breached the the Rs 1,000 crore sales mark the same year followed by Wheel which crossed the Rs.2,000 crore sales milestone in 2008.
On 17th October 2008 , HUL completed 75 years of corporate existence in India. In January 2010, the HUL head office shifted from the landmark Lever House, at Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai to the new campus in Andheri (E), Mumbai.
</p>
<p>
On 15th November, 2010, the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan was officially launched in India at New Delhi.
In March, 2012 HUL’s state of the art Learning Centre was inaugurated at the Hindustan Unilever campus at Andheri, Mumbai.
In April, 2012, the Customer Insight & Innovation Centre (CiiC) was inaugurated at the Hindustan Unilever campus at Andheri, Mumbai
</p>
<p>
HUL completed 80 years of corporate existence in India on October 17th, 2013.</p>
